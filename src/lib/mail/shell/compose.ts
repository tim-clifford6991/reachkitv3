// BUILD §12 — composeMail(): one block list, two bodies, one decision.
//
// Both renderers are called on the same `MailBlock[]`, so a template
// cannot author a text body and cannot omit one, and the two bodies
// cannot disagree about what was left out. Pure and synchronous: no I/O,
// no clock, no interpolation engine, no model — with every language model
// unavailable this function returns exactly the same two strings.
//
// The whole-mail line is chosen here, after every block has rendered,
// because it is a fact about the mail rather than about any block:
//
//   · the week was not measured at all → it says so, and when the next
//     measurement is due;
//   · the week was only partly measured → it names which sections could
//     not be measured, rather than dropping them silently;
//   · otherwise, where every conditional section was omitted or came out
//     empty → it says there was nothing to report.
//
// A mail with a measured section carries no whole-mail line, and the two
// measurement exceptions never coexist with the nothing-to-report line.
// `measurement` is required for `'weekly'` and rejected for every other
// kind — a type error, not a runtime check.
