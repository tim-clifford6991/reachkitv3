// BUILD §4.2 — the address-wide suppression store.
//
// **Read ADR-042 before unifying this with the notification toggles.**
// This store is keyed by an email address and reaches exactly the kinds
// whose register row says `stoppable: 'opt-out'` — today, the nurture
// sequence. `users.notify` is keyed by a user and reaches the three
// recurring mails. They overlap in no row. Merging them has one obvious
// default — an address-keyed suppression suppresses that address — and
// that default takes a magic-link customer's sign-in mail away, silently,
// discovered when they cannot get back in. This module never reads and
// never writes `users.notify`, and imports nothing that does.
//
// **Read ADR-041 before adding a suppression check to the giveaway.** An
// address on this store that submits the capture control for a *different*
// domain still receives that domain's page. `first-page` and
// `first-page-unavailable` are `stoppable: false`, so the send seam does
// not consult this store for them at all — the check exists in one place
// and reaches exactly the follow-up. An opt-out here stops what comes
// next; it does not refuse a page the person has just asked for.
//
// **Why the write order is what it is.** A suppression must both record
// the address and stop the sequences already running for it, and this
// client has no transaction. So the suppression is written **first**: with
// it in place every nurture send is refused at the seam (the store is
// consulted immediately before the vendor call), and the sequence rows are
// then converged to `stopped`. A failure between the two leaves rows
// reading `running` that can send nothing, which is a stale label; the
// reverse order would leave an address with no suppression row and no
// running sequences — and the next delivery would start a fresh one. The
// job's own send step re-reads this store and stops any row it finds
// suppressed, so the label converges on the next invocation.
