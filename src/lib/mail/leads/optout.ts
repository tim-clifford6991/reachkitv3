// BUILD §4.2 — the opt-out token: one capability, no expiry, idempotent.
//
// The link every lead-directed mail carries (REQ-010 criterion 11, "any of
// these emails"). It is signed over an **email address** and it can do
// exactly one thing: suppress that address's follow-up. It is a different
// token, over a different subject, from the kind-scoped
// `/unsubscribe/{token}` the three notification switches use — ADR-042
// fixes two formats permanently, and the two signing keys are separated by
// their HKDF labels so neither token can ever be presented as the other.
//
// **No expiry is encoded**, so none can be checked: a link in a mail
// someone finds a year later must still work, or the reader is holding a
// mail they cannot switch off.
//
// **Applying is the arrival.** `applyOptOutToken` writes, and the page
// behind the link calls it on arrival rather than offering a button to
// press. The kind-scoped unsubscribe deliberately splits reading from
// writing so a mail client's link prefetch cannot switch a customer's mail
// off; here the trade runs the other way. A prefetch that suppresses
// follow-up costs the reader nothing they cannot undo — submitting the
// capture control again still delivers the page they ask for, because
// `first-page` is unstoppable — while a button costs a reader who cannot
// press one their only way out. Over-stopping follow-up is the safe
// direction, and REQ-010 c11 says using the link stops the mail, not that
// pressing a second control does.
//
// **Signing key.** `BUILD.md` §15's binding list carries no opt-out secret
// and `src/lib/config/env.ts` is the owner's file, so the key is derived
// from an existing server-only secret through HKDF with a fixed, unique
// label — domain-separated, so it is neither the salt itself nor
// exchangeable with the unsubscribe token's key. Owner-owed: a dedicated
// binding would be better, and swapping to one is one line here.
