// BUILD §4.2 — one insert, confirmed only after it commits.
//
// The control this backs asks for an email address and nothing else: no
// account, no password, no payment, no further field, and the argument type
// is what says so — none of them is representable in the call.
//
// **Fail closed.** The confirmation is the last statement in the function,
// so no code path can confirm a capture that did not commit: a store that
// will not take the row means the submission is refused in writing and
// nothing is confirmed (REQ-003 c10). This is the opposite of the scan
// limiter, which fails **open** — `BUILD.md` §11's asymmetry, deliberate in
// both directions: letting an extra stranger scan costs a few cents, while
// telling a founder their address was taken when it was not costs them the
// page they traded it for.
//
// **Nothing else happens on the visitor's request.** No model call, no
// vendor round trip, no queue. Writing the page costs ~7¢ and is spent in
// the job, on identified leads only (`BUILD.md` §4.2), which is also why
// the confirmation can only ever state that the address was accepted —
// the one thing true at that moment.
//
// **Read ADR-041 before adding a suppression check here.** Capture does not
// consult `email_suppressions`. A suppressed address that submits the
// control for a different domain still gets that domain's page: REQ-010 c3
// against c11, and the mechanism that makes it so is the `stoppable: false`
// register row, not a branch in this file.
