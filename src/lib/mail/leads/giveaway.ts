// BUILD §4.2 — one page, once, or a written message saying why not.
//
// The draft is generated **only after** the email is submitted (~7¢, spent
// on identified leads only), and never on the visitor's request: this
// function is the job's, and `captureLead` enqueues nothing and calls no
// model. Writing the page itself is §8's (issue #44) and is reached through
// the declared port in `ports.ts` — this module maps its two refusals to
// two causes and holds no rule of its own about how a page is written.
//
// **One `generateDraft()` call per lead, ever.** The guard is
// `first_page_state`: the port is reached from exactly one place below, and
// only while the state is `pending`. A retry re-sends what was written and
// never re-writes it, so an abandoned delivery costs one generation and not
// seven.
//
// **Read ADR-041 before adding a suppression check to this send.**
// `first-page` and `first-page-unavailable` are `stoppable: false`, so the
// send seam does not consult `email_suppressions` for them. A suppressed
// address that submitted the control for a *different* domain still
// receives that domain's page. It reads as the one thing no mail system may
// ever do, and it is REQ-010 c3: "a mail the founder cannot stop: it is the
// thing they asked for, sent once, in answer to their own submission". The
// opt-out in that same mail stops the follow-up, not the page.
//
// **Nothing is recorded as delivered that was not.** Every state advance
// below happens after the send seam says `sent: true`, and the terminal
// `abandoned` state says in the row itself that neither of the two things
// the founder was owed arrived.
