// BUILD §12 — sendEmail(): the one seam every mail leaves through.
//
// Compose once, consult **exactly one** stoppability store — chosen by the
// sending kind's own register row — and reach the vendor only if that
// store says send. `MAIL_KINDS[kind].stoppable` is the dispatch, not
// documentation (ADR-042): `'toggle'` asks the customer's three switches,
// `'opt-out'` asks the address-wide suppression store, `false` asks
// neither. There is no call that asks both and no helper that unifies
// them. Merging them takes a magic-link customer's sign-in mail away,
// silently, and the customer discovers it when they cannot get back in.
//
// The consult happens **immediately before the vendor call**, never at
// schedule time: a customer who switches a mail off between the two must
// not receive it.
//
// This function never throws and is **not idempotent on its own** — a
// caller that must send at most once carries its own natural key. It
// retries nothing either; the retry window belongs to whoever owns the
// occasion.
