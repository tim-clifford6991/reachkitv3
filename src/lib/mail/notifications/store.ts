// BUILD §12 · §4.7 — the three notification switches, on the user's row.
//
// Keyed by **user**, reaching exactly the three recurring mails. This
// store never reads and never writes the address-wide suppression store
// (ADR-042): merging the two is the cleanup that takes a magic-link
// customer's sign-in mail away, silently.
//
// The column is `users.notify jsonb`, default `{}` (migration
// `00000000000003_users_notify_column.sql`). A **sparse** object: a key
// that is absent reads as *on*. Never toggled is not the same fact as
// switched off, and the customer bought a product that mails them.
//
// A read that fails is its own outcome and never `{}` — an absent object
// and an unreachable store are different facts, and collapsing them would
// mail a customer who had switched a mail off.
//
// **Schema-typing gap, flagged once (same class as `costs/ledger.ts`):**
// `users.notify` exists in the applied schema but not in
// `src/lib/db/types.generated.ts`, which is stale and is BP-002's artifact
// to regenerate, not this module's file to widen. The column is reached
// through a narrow, explicitly cast query-builder subset rather than by
// losing typing everywhere else `db()` reaches.
