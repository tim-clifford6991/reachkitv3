// BUILD §12 · §4.7 — the three toggles, and the one question the send seam asks.
//
// Settings holds three switches over the three recurring mails
// (BUILD §4.7, "Notifications (3 toggles)"). They suppress no mail but
// their own: with all three off, the sign-in link, anything the product
// must say about the account or the subscription, the setup reminder and
// the one unsuppressible draft-ready announcement all still arrive.
//
// `TOGGLABLE_KINDS` is derived from the register (`kinds.ts`), never
// stated twice — a fourth `'toggle'` row would appear here the day it was
// added, and `tests/mail/notifications/togglable-kinds.test.ts` asserts
// the two agree. `MailKind` is imported **type-only** where it is only a
// type, so this module and the register cannot form a runtime cycle.
//
// ADR-042: this store is keyed by user and reaches exactly these three
// kinds. It never reads and never writes the address-wide suppression
// store, and there is no code path from one to the other.
