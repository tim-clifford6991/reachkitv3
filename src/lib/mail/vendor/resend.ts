// BUILD §12 · §15 — the one Resend request, carrying both bodies.
//
// One request per send, both bodies inside it, so the plain-text
// alternative is a property of the request rather than of a second send
// that could be forgotten. **Nothing here throws:** every failure — a
// refused socket, a timeout, a 4xx, an unreadable response — becomes a
// `VendorResult`, because a mail that cannot be sent must never take down
// the job that was sending it.
//
// Not `safeFetch()`. BP-006's guard exists for URLs a *customer* or a
// dataset supplied — it resolves, checks the address against a policy and
// refuses private space. The Resend API host is one we wrote down, not one
// anybody handed us, and `safeFetch` is a GET-only reader besides.
// `node:https` is used directly here for the same reason `safe-fetch.ts`
// itself uses it, and this module makes no `fetch()` call, so the
// `no-fetch-outside-egress` fence is kept rather than worked around.
// Recorded so the next reader does not "fix" it.
//
// **Logs carry no address and no body.** The recipient appears only as a
// truncated digest, which is enough to correlate two sends to the same
// person and not enough to reach them.
