// BUILD §12 — the register of mail kinds, and the partition of this module.
//
// Ten rows, and a mail on any other occasion does not compile: `MailKind`
// is the keys of this constant, and every seam that sends takes one. The
// product sends no marketing, newsletter or promotional mail at all —
// there is no row for one, and adding one is a change to this file, read
// by the owner, not a call-site argument.
//
// `stoppable` is the dispatch, not documentation (ADR-042). Exactly one
// store is consulted per send, chosen by this field:
//
//   'opt-out'  → the address-wide suppression store (§4.2's lead
//                opt-out; `src/lib/mail/leads/**`, issue #31)
//   'toggle'   → the customer's own three switches on `users.notify`
//                (BUILD §4.7 Notifications; `notifications/`)
//   false      → neither store is asked
//
// Merging the two stores is the cleanup ADR-042 exists to forbid: on
// magic-link auth the sign-in mail *is* the credential, so an address-wide
// unsubscribe that reached `magic-link` would lock a paying customer out
// of the product with no recovery channel. Two mechanisms, two stores, two
// token formats, permanently.
//
// ADR-040: a kind's template is a directory named for that kind,
// `src/lib/mail/templates/<kind>/`, owned by the feature that owns the
// occasion. `MailKind` and the directory name are the same string —
// `tests/mail/kinds/template-directories.test.ts` holds them to it. This
// module holds no template, no shell and no vendor knowledge.
