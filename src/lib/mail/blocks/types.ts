// BUILD §12 — the only vocabulary a mail template may speak.
//
// Eight arms, and nothing else. A template hands `composeMail()` a list of
// these and holds no conditional of its own: every value that can be
// absent enters as a `Measured<T>` (`src/lib/measure/measured.ts`), so a
// template cannot format a number itself and cannot forget BUILD §12's
// omission rule ("all values conditional: a missing number omits its
// section, never prints 0"). Which blocks are dropped is decided once, in
// `omit.ts`, and both renderers read that one decision.
//
// Every sentence is a `CopyKey`. `pageBody` is the one arm carrying a
// string that is not a key — the draft page itself — and it carries the
// two fields `generatedLabel()` needs, so model text cannot reach a mail
// without the label that identifies it (ADR-012, §8's `GeneratedText`
// rule). There is no ninth arm and no free-string escape hatch.
