// BUILD §12 — the omission rule, decided once.
//
// "All values conditional: a missing number omits its section, never
// prints 0." The rule has three halves and this file owns the first:
//
//   1. A `stat`, `list` or `verdicts` block whose `Measured` is
//      `unmeasured` is dropped entirely — no zero, no dash, no
//      placeholder, and its `note` goes with it.
//   2. A measured zero prints as zero. There is no zero branch here to
//      delete: `omittedIndexes` narrows by exclusion, so the `zero` arm is
//      reachable only through the same path as `measured`.
//   3. A measured-but-empty list states its empty result in one written
//      line — that is a render, not an omission, and it lives in the two
//      renderers.
//
// Both `html.ts` and `text.ts` call this and neither computes an omission
// of its own. A rule that held in one body and not the other is the exact
// failure the single plain-text renderer exists to prevent.
