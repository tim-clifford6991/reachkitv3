/** REQ-004's trichotomy, rendered. Exactly two branches — this shape, and
 *  not a three-arm switch:
 *
 *  (a) An unmeasured value cannot become a number. Inside the guard, `m`
 *  narrows to the `unmeasured` arm, which carries no `value` field.
 *  `o.format` is the only path from a `T` to a string, and the arm
 *  supplies none — "render an outage as 0" is uninhabited, not merely
 *  wrong.
 *
 *  (b) A measured zero cannot be dashed by a local edit. The fall-through
 *  is one branch covering `measured` and `zero` together, reached by
 *  narrowing by exclusion — the literal zero-kind string never appears in
 *  this file, so there is no zero branch to edit. */
