// src/lib/presentation/copy/registry.ts — BP-020, WO-041
//
// The closed partition list, written once (BP-020 decision 5). Every
// sentence the product speaks in its own voice is composed here from the
// twelve `keys/*.ts` partitions — no thirteenth import, no re-export by
// name. `COPY` and `COPY_META` are frozen object literals in the bundle,
// never a fetch, a template store or an i18n catalogue (REQ-093 criterion
// 5): with every language model unavailable, every value here still reads
// the same, because nothing here ever reached for one.
//
// `CopyMeta` and `CopyPartition` are declared here — the one place the file
// plan assigns them — and every `keys/*.ts` partition imports them back with
// `import type`, never a value import. A type-only import is erased before
// the bundle exists, so the apparent cycle (this file value-imports the
// partitions; the partitions type-import this file) is not a runtime cycle
// at all: nothing survives to `require`/`import` at either end.

// this spread — TypeScript does not diagnose overlapping keys contributed
// by two different spread expressions, it silently lets the later one win.
// `registry.test.ts` — "the partition list is closed and total" — is what
// actually catches a collision, by checking the twelve source partitions
// pairwise for a shared key before this spread ever runs.

 *  value's `copy()` throw takes the screen down with it, which hides the
 *  eleven modules that were finished from the review the owner needs to
 *  do to write the twelfth's sentence.
 *
 *  Renderable is not invisible. This list is derived the same way
 *  `OWNER_OWED` is — a key is awaiting copy exactly when its value is the
 *  marker — so "what is still unwritten" stays one question with one
 *  answer, and `tests/presentation/copy/registry.test.ts` counts both
