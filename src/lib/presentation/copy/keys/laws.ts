// src/lib/presentation/copy/keys/laws.ts — BP-020 decision 5, WO-041
//
// The sentences the cross-cutting laws are made of, which no single surface
// owns: the five stopped-work lines, the five next-publish lines and the
// two generated-page lines (WO-041 step 3). BP-019 decision 6 adds a
// fourth law's three keys later (WO-249); this file seeds only these
// twelve.
//
// 2026-09-04: the owner ruled on three of the twelve (WO-041 `## Log`,
// this date's ruling) — `stopped.work.line`, `stopped.work.needs-nothing`
// and `next-publish.scheduled` — filled verbatim, byte for byte, and no
// longer owner-owed. The remaining nine were not part of this ruling.
//
// 2026-09-04, separately: WO-278 (BP-019 decision 6, WO-249's block) closes
// the fourth cross-cutting law — `law: 'unmeasured'` — with the three keys
// `renderMeasured`'s `unmeasuredLine: CopyKey` argument takes. Two are
// owner-owed and empty (REQ-004 criteria 6 and 9's own written lines are
// the owner's, constitution §1); the third, `unmeasured.dash`, carries a
// value — a transcription of REQ-004's own "—" character, on the same
// footing as the thirteen band words, and the reason no dash literal
// appears anywhere in `src/lib/presentation/`.
//
// 2026-09-04, separately again: WO-287 (owner ruling 2026-09-04, sheet 2 —
// `registry/evidence/RULING-copy-2026-09-04.json`) fills
// `unmeasured.undeterminable` and `unmeasured.not-attempted`, filled
// verbatim, byte for byte; neither is owner-owed any longer. Each declares
// one `what: "text"` slot — the subject that could not be measured — the
// slot the ruled sentence itself takes; `renderMeasured` (BP-019,
// `src/lib/presentation/measured.ts`) gains the matching options member
// to supply it. `unmeasured.dash` is untouched.
//
// 2026-09-05, separately again: issue #9 (BUILD §4.4, REQ-040) adds the
// seven `shell.*` keys the app shell speaks on every app screen — sentences
// no single screen owns, which is why they sit here beside the
// `next-publish.*` family the same shell renders. Two are owner-owed and
// empty (REQ-040 c6's week line and c7's not-measured line are written
// sentences and therefore the owner's, constitution §1). Five carry a
// value, and every one of them is a **transcription** of a word `BUILD.md`
// itself prints, on the same footing as the thirteen band words: §4.4's
// "nav **Overview / Calendar / Settings**" and §4.3's "Autopilot (default,
// selected)". Nothing here is composed.
//
// 2026-09-06, issue #20 (REQ-091/REQ-092): seven values moved from `""` to
// `TODO(copy)` — `stopped.work.resumes-on`, `stopped.work.no-time-promised`,
// `stopped.work.partial-pass` and the four unfilled `next-publish.*` lines.
// The reason is the standing ruling in #93 ("owner-owed copy keys on fixture
// screens render as the visible marker `TODO(copy)`; mail keeps the
// throw"), reached here by REQ-091 c2: a place holding nothing must carry
// **one written line, never a blank**, so an empty value — which `copy()`
// refuses to render — is the one thing these keys may not hold. Still the
// owner's sentences; the owner's words replaced the marker on 2026-09-10
// (below).
//
// 2026-09-10, issue #460: every sentence this partition still owed is now
// written — the owner approved the master's drafted set ("copy proposal
// approved", proposal sheet
// https://claude.ai/code/artifact/546f45a0-a996-4d25-b85e-fb03fda7b102) and
// the strings land here byte for byte. The values named in the approval
// file are the owner's; nothing here is composed.
