// src/lib/presentation/copy/keys/mail.ts — BP-020 decision 5, WO-041
//
// The mail seam's sentences, BP-016 and BP-029. Two keys seeded (WO-041
// step 4): the opt-out confirmation and invalid-token lines. Empty value,
// owner-owed — no string is written here (constitution §1). BP-029 owns
// the opt-out surface and lives in src/lib/mail/leads/**, so this is
// already the right module for its two lines; no thirteenth partition is
// needed for them.
//
// 2026-09-04: the owner ruled on both (WO-041 `## Log`, this date's
// ruling) — filled verbatim, byte for byte. Neither is owner-owed any
// more.

  // 2026-09-05, issue #30 (the mail seam, BUILD §12). Six keys the shell
  // and the whole-mail line need. Five are owner-owed and empty: every one
  // of them is a sentence the product speaks in its own voice, so none is
  // written here (constitution §1 / CLAUDE.md "never invent copy"). The
  // sixth is the product's own name, transcribed — not a sentence, on the
  // same footing as the em-dash and the removal address that two other
  // partitions transcribe. (Those two keys are not named here: issue #28's
  // `tests/app/scan-address/removal.test.tsx` asserts one of them appears
  // in exactly one file under `src/`, and a comment naming it is a second.)
  //
  // Note on the empty five: `copy()` throws on an owner-owed key, so a
  // mail that would carry one of these lines fails loudly at compose time
  // rather than shipping an empty line to a customer. That is the intended
  // behaviour and `tests/mail/shell/whole-mail-line.test.ts` asserts it,
  // written so it keeps discriminating once the owner fills them.
