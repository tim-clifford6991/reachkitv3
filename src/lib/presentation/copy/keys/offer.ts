// src/lib/presentation/copy/keys/offer.ts — BP-020 decision 5, WO-041
//
// The price and offer surfaces' sentences, BP-030 and BP-031 — the
// twelfth partition, added by the planner under constitution rule 1.1 (see
// WO-041 "## Decision taken under rule 1.1", second entry): BP-020
// decision 5 named eleven partitions before the seven BP-001-owned
// surfaces existed, and /pricing's sentences have no module in that list.
// Declared here, where the partition list is written once anyway, so
// registry.ts keeps exactly one author.
//
// Nine keys seeded (WO-041 step 4): BP-030's PRICE_COPY_KEYS (price.*) and
// BP-031's offer.* keys. Empty value, owner-owed — no string is written
// here (constitution §1). The four offer.cadence.*/offer.veto.* keys carry
// a `value` slot: the values are BP-005 pins supplied by BP-031's
// offerTerms(), never written into the sentence here.
//
// 2026-09-04: the owner ruled on seven of the nine (WO-041 `## Log`, this
// date's ruling) — `price.amount`, `price.interval`, `offer.start` and the
// four `offer.cadence.*`/`offer.veto.*` slotted lines — filled verbatim,
// byte for byte, and no longer owner-owed. `price.vat_included` and
// `offer.cancel_self_service` were not part of this ruling and remain
// owner-owed, empty.

  // now. Three are pure owner words with no number in them. The fourth
  // carries the number from its pin — `VETO.defaultHours`
  // (`src/lib/config/constants.ts`) — through an `{hours}` slot, so the
  // veto window is written down once, in the pin, and the owner supplies
  // only the unit around it. `TODO(copy)` per `CLAUDE.md`.
