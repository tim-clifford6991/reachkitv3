// src/lib/presentation/copy/keys/settings.ts — BP-020 decision 5, WO-041
//
// Settings' sentences. No string was seeded here at WO-041. The block that owns Settings fills this file and touches no other
// partition.
//
// 2026-09-05: issue #9 (BUILD §4.4) added `settings.head` — the one written
// line the screen stated inside the app shell until its own content landed.
//
// 2026-09-05: issue #18 (BUILD §4.7) fills the screen. Every key below is
// one of exactly two things, and the distinction is the whole rule this
// file is written under:
//
//   **A transcription.** A word or a sentence `BUILD.md` itself prints,
//   filled verbatim, byte for byte — the footing `laws.ts` records for the
//   thirteen band words and the five `shell.*` words ("every one of them is
//   a **transcription** of a word `BUILD.md` itself prints … Nothing here is
//   composed"). §4.7 prints the seven card names, the control words (`Edit`,
//   `add`, `remove`, `Reconnect`, `Update card`, `Cancel plan`, `change
//   email`, `sign out`, `Export everything`) and three of the screen's
//   sentences outright; §8 prints "Brand voice" and "Do-not-claim list"; §10
//   prints the destination kinds and the three health words; §12 prints the
//   three recurring mails' own names. Each key's `fixedBy` names the clause
//   it transcribes, so a reviewer can check the byte-for-byte claim without
//   leaving the file.
//
//   **The owner's.** A sentence nothing in the spec writes — the magic-link
//   note, and the line an action that is not yet wired reports. Its words
//   are the owner's, never composed here.
//
// Three transcriptions read as lower-case fragments because that is how the
// spec prints them ("changing this rebuilds …", "cancelling keeps …",
// "add/remove"). They are left exactly as printed rather than sentence-cased:
// capitalising is a wording decision and wording is the owner's
// (constitution §1). Flagged in this issue's PR body.
//
// 2026-09-10, issue #460: every sentence this partition still owed is now
// written — the owner approved the master's drafted set ("copy proposal
// approved", proposal sheet
// https://claude.ai/code/artifact/546f45a0-a996-4d25-b85e-fb03fda7b102)
// and the strings land here byte for byte. The values that approval names
// are the owner's; nothing here is composed.
