// src/lib/presentation/copy/keys/report.ts — BP-020 decision 5, WO-041; the
// eight landing keys added by WO-070.
//
// The report surface's sentences. One key seeded (WO-041 step 3): the
// no-presence-yet line for the first page of the rival list. Empty value,
// owner-owed — no string is written here (constitution §1: customer-visible
// strings are the owner's). The block that owns the report surface fills
// every other sentence this surface needs.
//
// WO-070 adds the landing page's eight keys here rather than in a
// thirteenth partition (constitution rule 2.2/BP-020 decision 5's own
// reasoning, applied the same way WO-249 applied it to `laws.ts`): BP-022
// is "the leaf that owns the landing field, the report address, and
// everything that decides what loads there" (BP-022 `## Responsibility`)
// — one node, one partition file, so the landing headline, field label,
// submit label and the five `DomainProblem` lines (`src/lib/scan/domain.ts`,
// WO-051) sit beside the one key this surface already owned.
//
// 2026-09-03: the owner ruled on the headline, field label and submit
// label (WO-070 `## Log`, "landing copy approved"; strings per `BUILD.md`
// §3) — those three are filled verbatim, byte for byte, and no longer
// owner-owed.
//
// 2026-09-04: the owner ruled on the five `DomainProblem` lines (WO-070
// `## Log`, this date's ruling) — filled verbatim, byte for byte. All
// eight landing keys are now supplied; none is owner-owed. No `law` tag
// on any of the eight: none of `CopyMeta.law`'s four cross-cutting arms
// names this surface.
//
// 2026-09-04, separately: the owner also ruled on this file's other key,
// `place.report.first-page.rival` (WO-041 `## Log`, this date's ruling) —
// filled verbatim, byte for byte. Every key this partition declares now
// has a string; none is owner-owed.
//
// 2026-09-04, separately again: WO-278 (BP-024 decision 6, rule 1.1 — see
// `## Decision taken under rule 1.1`) adds the three `verdict.limiting.*`
// keys `LIMITING_LINES` (`src/lib/presentation/bands.ts`) resolves — one
// per `ScoreFactorName`. They ship owner-owed and empty: the one written
// line REQ-004 criterion 2 requires is a customer-visible string and
// therefore the owner's (constitution §1). No sentence is written here.
//
// 2026-09-04, separately again: WO-287 (owner ruling 2026-09-04, sheet 2 —
// `registry/evidence/RULING-copy-2026-09-04.json`) fills the three
// `verdict.limiting.*` values above, filled verbatim, byte for byte; none
// is owner-owed any longer. The same ruling adds thirteen new keys for the
// report address's own sentences — `removal.*`, `notice.*`, `control.*`
// and `copy-link.label` — the gap the design-guardian named on WO-282's
// v1 preview (its `## Log`, 2026-09-04 preview line). They land in this
// partition rather than a thirteenth (constitution rule 2.2/BP-020
// decision 5, the same reasoning WO-070 and WO-249 already applied here
// and to `laws.ts`): BP-022 owns the report address, and `report.ts` is
// its partition. No `law` tag on any of the thirteen: none of
// `CopyMeta.law`'s four cross-cutting arms names this surface.
//
// 2026-09-05, issue #13: the free report screen's own modules — the verdict
// strip's provenance line, the AI-answers card, the Google-presence card,
// the three problem cards, the three DIY sections and the free-page card
// (`BUILD.md` §4.1 modules 1 to 5, as amended by DECISIONS 2026-09-03 —
// no driver bars, no per-question volume, no market-total footnote). They
// land in this partition for the reason WO-070, WO-249 and WO-287 already
// landed theirs here: BP-022 owns the report address and `report.ts` is
// its partition (BP-020 decision 5 / constitution rule 2.2).
//
// **Every one of them ships with the value `TODO(copy)`** — `CLAUDE.md`'s
// standing rule for this repo ("add the key, leave the value `TODO(copy)`,
// flag it in the PR"), which supersedes the archived corpus's
// empty-string-plus-throw convention for keys minted from here on. The
// difference is deliberate and visible: an empty value makes `copy()`
// throw, which would take the whole screen down and hide the other
// eleven modules from the owner's review; `TODO(copy)` renders as itself,
// so the owner sees exactly which sentence each module is waiting for,
// in place, in both themes. No sentence is written here.
//
// Module 6, the pricing card, mints nothing: its eight sentences are
// `offer.ts`'s `price.*`/`offer.*` keys, already ruled 2026-09-04.
