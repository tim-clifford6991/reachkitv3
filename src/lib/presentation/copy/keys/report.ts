// src/lib/presentation/copy/keys/report.ts — BP-020 decision 5, WO-041; the
// eight landing keys added by WO-070.
//
// The report surface's sentences. One key seeded (WO-041 step 3): the
// no-presence-yet line for the first page of the rival list. Empty value,
// owner-owed — no string is written here (constitution §1: customer-visible
// strings are the owner's). The block that owns the report surface fills
// every other sentence this surface needs.
//
// WO-070 adds the landing page's eight keys here rather than in a
// thirteenth partition (constitution rule 2.2/BP-020 decision 5's own
// reasoning, applied the same way WO-249 applied it to `laws.ts`): BP-022
// is "the leaf that owns the landing field, the report address, and
// everything that decides what loads there" (BP-022 `## Responsibility`)
// — one node, one partition file, so the landing headline, field label,
// submit label and the five `DomainProblem` lines (`src/lib/scan/domain.ts`,
// WO-051) sit beside the one key this surface already owned.
//
// 2026-09-03: the owner ruled on the headline, field label and submit
// label (WO-070 `## Log`, "landing copy approved"; strings per `BUILD.md`
// §3) — those three are filled verbatim, byte for byte, and no longer
// owner-owed.
//
// 2026-09-04: the owner ruled on the five `DomainProblem` lines (WO-070
// `## Log`, this date's ruling) — filled verbatim, byte for byte. All
// eight landing keys are now supplied; none is owner-owed. No `law` tag
// on any of the eight: none of `CopyMeta.law`'s four cross-cutting arms
// names this surface.
//
// 2026-09-04, separately: the owner also ruled on this file's other key,
// `place.report.first-page.rival` (WO-041 `## Log`, this date's ruling) —
// filled verbatim, byte for byte. Every key this partition declares now
// has a string; none is owner-owed.
//
// 2026-09-04, separately again: WO-278 (BP-024 decision 6, rule 1.1 — see
// `## Decision taken under rule 1.1`) adds the three `verdict.limiting.*`
// keys `LIMITING_LINES` (`src/lib/presentation/bands.ts`) resolves — one
// per `ScoreFactorName`. They ship owner-owed and empty: the one written
// line REQ-004 criterion 2 requires is a customer-visible string and
// therefore the owner's (constitution §1). No sentence is written here.
