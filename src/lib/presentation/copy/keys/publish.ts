// src/lib/presentation/copy/keys/publish.ts — BP-020 decision 5, WO-041
//
// Publishing's sentences. Seeded empty by WO-041; the block that owns
// publishing fills this file and touches no other partition.
//
// 2026-09-10, issue #459: the owner approved the master's drafted copy for
// every key this partition still owed ("copy proposal approved"; proposal
// sheet artifact 546f45a0-a996-4d25-b85e-fb03fda7b102), and the 38 approved
// strings are applied here byte for byte. Where a note below says how a
// key stood before, that was its standing before this date.
//
// 2026-09-11, issue #516: `record.verification.never.noLiveAddress` was the
// one key #459 held — its drafted sentence clipped the record's badge at
// 320 px — and the owner approved a badge-length string for it (DECISIONS
// 2026-09-11), applied byte for byte. No key in this partition is
// owner-owed or `TODO(copy)` any more.
//
// 2026-09-06, issue #47 (REQ-063): the four words a published page's
// weekly standing is spoken as. They live here, and not in `keys/mail.ts`,
// because they are not the mail's: §4.5's Overview and §4.6's calendar
// speak the same four, and one home is what stops a screen and a mail
// wording the same verdict differently. The first surface to read these is
// the Monday mail, where "a mail never ships a placeholder" (the owner's
// 2026-09-05 ruling on #93); they stood empty until the owner approved
// them on 2026-09-10 (#459).
//
// The fourth is not a fourth verdict: REQ-063 c6's page carries it "in
// place of the three", and the line naming *which* of the five causes
// happened, with the date of the last verdict it received, is a separate
// sentence a screen speaks — owner-owed and not minted here (the mail
// carries the standing, not the explanation).

  // **The pair is two keys and never one key with the tense interpolated

  // address this page was published at" are a customer-visible
  // distinction — the second is said of a page ReachKit has stopped
  // serving, and ReachKit never goes back to look — so making the tense a

  //
  // **`due` states no moment.** "The check is due" is about now, and a
  // date printed beside it would read as an observation ReachKit has not
  // made. The two `never` arms state none either: no check will run, so

  // stays — it is the outcome §9 promises for a page ReachKit created but
  // did not make live — and because a deleted key is how an empty arm
  // becomes unrenderable and therefore deletable next. It is not the same
