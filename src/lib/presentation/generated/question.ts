// admitted only on the condition that the search it was derived from is
// shown with it — so this returns an ordered pair the surface renders
// whole. There is no function that returns the wording alone. The
// *content* of `provenance` is REQ-006 criterion 9's and is built by that
// requirement's node; this file owns only that the pair cannot be split.
