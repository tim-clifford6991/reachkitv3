// src/lib/presentation/generated/text.ts — BP-020, WO-279 (supersedes WO-043)
//
// Model output, wrapped at the point it is read out of storage. `fromStored`
// is this module's only exported constructor of `GeneratedText`, no
// overload accepts a literal, and no widening cast appears in this file —
// that closes a cast-based or second-constructor mint *inside this
// module*. Corrected per TST-028 finding 2: `GeneratedText` is a plain,
// unbranded interface (BP-020's declared shape), so TypeScript's structural
// typing accepts a hand-written object literal shaped `{ source: 'model',
// text: <any string> }`, written in *any* file — including a real surface —
// wherever a `GeneratedText` is expected, with no cast and no second
// constructor at all. This module does not close that path. `GeneratedText`
// is BP-020's declared interface (rule 2.4 — one claim, one home), so the
// gap and its disposition are BP-020's to carry, not restated as a second
// copy here; see `tests/presentation/generated/text.test.ts`'s matching
// describe for a reproduction of the exact construction TST-028's
// validator used.
//
// `renderGenerated` is the one sink for model text (REQ-093 criterion 2):
// it cannot be called without the identity of the page the text belongs
// to, and it returns the label and the text as one value, so a caller
// cannot render the text and drop the label. This file imports nothing
// under `src/lib/llm/` — REQ-093 criterion 5 holds because nothing here
// ever reaches for a model at render time; `renderGenerated` renders
// whatever `fromStored` read from storage, untouched.
