// The band and severity handle→CopyKey maps. Every value here is a
// CopyKey; no string a person reads lives in this file. `CopyKey` is a
// type-only import — this module contributes no runtime edge into the
// copy registry and cannot be the reason a surface pulls the whole copy
// table in. Imports nothing from `src/lib/config/`: the boundaries a score
// is banded against are BP-005's `SCORE_BAND_BOUNDS`; this file holds only
// the words a banded handle renders as.
//
// ADR-001 is why the two band sets (`winnability`, `rivalSize`) sit in one
// file, `BAND_LABELS` — the disjointness assertion it records is strong
// precisely because it iterates both sets from one export
// (`tests/pins.test.ts`, WO-007). No flattened array of the six band
// terms is exported here, and no `BAND_TERMS` constant: a hand-written
// six-element array would be the seventh copy that lets a fourth term
// through undetected (ADR-001 point 4).
