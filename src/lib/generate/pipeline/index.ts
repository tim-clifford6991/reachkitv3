// BUILD §8 — one page per opportunity, gated by the battery.
//
// The order is fixed and every part of it is §8's:
//
//   1. the ceiling, read before anything runs;
//   2. the grounding read — the customer's own live page, out of the
//      measurement ledger, never fetched again;
//   3. brief (nano) → outline (nano) → grounded draft (Haiku) →
//      answerability + SEO pass (Haiku);
//   4. the draft row, written with the grounded fact and the body;
//   5. the comparison set, and the hard-rule battery over the finished text
//      — including the claim check, which is step five;
//   6. `passed: true` and nothing else lets the item move toward review.
//
// **A failing draft is never queued and takes no day.** Nothing partial is
// published or handed to a destination. The row is written before the
// battery because the failure has to have somewhere to live — the cause a
// rejected day carries has to survive the run that produced it — and the
// row it is written to stays in `generating`, which is not a state anything
// publishes from.
//
// **A step that failed is not a rule that failed.** A model that did not
// answer, and the ceiling stopping a step, both give `step_failed`: they do
// not populate `failed`, they do not increment `hard_rule_attempts`, and
// they do not consume the one automatic regeneration — regenerating would
// not make an unavailable model available.
//
// **The hard rules bind what ReachKit generates, never what the customer
// writes.** This function is on the generation path only; an edit the
// customer saves does not come through here.
