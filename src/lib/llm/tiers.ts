// src/lib/llm/tiers.ts — WO-026, BP-009's two model tiers.
//
// The closed tier set — `nano` and `haiku`, no third (BP-009 `## Public
// interface`: `tier: 'nano' | 'haiku'`; file plan: "No third tier"). Each
// tier binds three things: the credential it authenticates with, the
// vendor model id it calls, and the per-token price and timeout budget it
// is held to.
//
// **Credential — settled elsewhere, not re-derived here (BP-005 decision
// 6b, shipped by WO-284).** `env.NANO_API_KEY` is already a required
// `string` by the time this module reads it: absent, `env.ts` itself
// resolved it to `env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` before either module's caller
// could observe which key it received. This file makes no fallback
// decision of its own — it reads the two already-resolved members and
// nothing else authenticates a call.
//
// **Price and timeout — transcribed, not chosen (rule 1.2).**
// `INFERENCE_PRICE_BOOK` is BP-005's `## Public interface`, verbatim.
// `INFERENCE_TIMEOUT_MS` is BP-009's `## NFR budget`, verbatim: "p95
// latency: nano ≤ 3 s, haiku ≤ 20 s." Both live in `constants.ts` and
// nowhere else (rule 2.4) — this file only reads them.
//
// **Model id — chosen, not transcribed (rule 1.1 — flagged once, here,
// per constitution rule 4.2, and in this WO's return).** No approved
// artifact states a machine-readable model id for either tier: BP-009's
// `## Public interface` declares only the abstract `tier` union, and the
// charter's own stack row (`00-project.md` / `BUILD.md` §1) reads "
// **Anthropic Haiku 4.5** (prose) + a nano-class model (scaffolding)" —
// a *class*, deliberately not a name, for the second tier. `haiku`'s id
// below transcribes the charter's own family name, unversioned (no
// snapshot date is stated anywhere the corpus can cite, so none is
// invented — rule 1.2).
//
// **`nano`'s id — corrected 2026-09-04, coordinator finding, superseding
// this file's first commit.** The first cut of this file picked
// `claude-fable-5` because the *name* read as a small/cheap tier; it is
// real, but its actual catalogue price is $10.00 input / $50.00 output
// per MTok — Anthropic's *most expensive* tier, wired into the cheapest
// lane. Against this file's own `INFERENCE_PRICE_BOOK.nano` pin
// (20/125 ¢/MTok), that is the ledger under-recording every nano call
// 50× on input and 40× on output — silently, since the price book and
// the id agreed with each other and were both wrong together; no test in
// `tests/llm/seam.test.ts` could see it, because none of them know the
// vendor's real price list. `nano` now points at `claude-haiku-4-5` —
// the same id as `haiku` — as the interim: it is the cheapest real model
// in the current catalogue, still 5× the `INFERENCE_PRICE_BOOK.nano` pin
// rather than 50×/40×, and it is not invented (rule 1.2's own
// discipline: pick a *real*, catalogue-verified id, never one chosen
// because its name sounds right). `INFERENCE_PRICE_BOOK.nano` itself is
// left untouched — that pin is BP-005's, transcribed, and a price is the
// owner's to move (decision-rights table, rule 1.2), not this file's.
// **This does not resolve the underlying gap — it is recorded as its own
// open `rests-on` row on WO-026**: no model in the current catalogue
// prices at 20/125 ¢/MTok, so `CAPS.FREE_C`'s ceiling is still computed
// from a price the product cannot actually buy at, at any nano id. That
// is the architect's and the owner's to resolve, not a code change here.
