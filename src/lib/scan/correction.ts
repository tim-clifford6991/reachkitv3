// src/lib/scan/correction.ts — BUILD §6.7 step 5, the stored side of the
// one market correction.
//
// The correction *decision* is the market module's — the coherence
// verdict, the offer and the state machine are pure and live there. This
// file is the two things that decision needs from storage and cannot get
// without it: the facts of the domain's current report, and the one
// conditional write that moves that report's `correction_state` forward.
// It holds no threshold, no allowance arithmetic and no state table: it
// reads `CorrectionState` values and writes the one it is handed.
//
// **Two stale-type gaps, worked around the way `admission.ts` already
// works around its own** (`untyped`, below, and that file's module header
// for the pattern): `scans.correction_state` and `scans.is_current` are on
// disk in `supabase/migrations/20260904110000_scans_current.sql` and
// neither is in the generated `Database` type, which has not been
// regenerated since. Both queries here go through a narrow, explicitly
// cast builder against a locally declared row shape; regenerating
// `types.generated.ts` is its own change, not this one.
//
// The removal list is *not* read here: `admission.ts` is the one file
// under `src/` that names that table (REQ-002 c4), and this module asks it
// rather than opening a second reader of the same fact.
//
// **The re-measurement itself is issue #25's `runScan`, which is not on
// disk.** Rather than fork a second pipeline here, this module declares
// the one seam that pipeline registers itself through
// (`registerCorrectionRunner`) and answers honestly while nothing is
// registered: `correctionRunner()` returns `null`, and the correction is
// refused *before it runs* — the same arm as free scanning being paused or
// switched off, which costs the reader neither attempt and leaves the
// control standing. Nothing here writes a state that a missing pipeline
// would then strand.
