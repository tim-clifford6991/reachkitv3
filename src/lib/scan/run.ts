// BUILD §4.1, §6.2, §6.3, §6.5 — the one scan pipeline. Tier is a parameter.
//
// Six named stages in `STAGES` order, under the tier's spend cap and — on
// the free path — the ninety-second deadline, ending in exactly one stored
// report or in a failure that leaves the previous report untouched.
//
// **The pipeline never branches on tier; only its parameters change.** One
// frozen `Record<Tier, TierParameters>` holds the cap name, the SERP mode,
// whether the report deadline applies and whether the pass adopts an
// admission claim. No `if (tier === …)` selects a different stage, a
// different formula or a different battery anywhere below: the same six
// stages run over the same callees at every tier. Cold start branches
// nothing at all (§6.6) — a domain that ranks for nothing runs every stage
// and stores a report whose empty sections are `zero`, not `unmeasured`.
//
// **This file orders calls and nothing else.** Every figure in the stored
// blob is the value its callee returned; no arithmetic is applied to a
// measured value here, nothing is parsed here, and nothing under
// `src/lib/presentation/`, `src/ui/` or `src/app/` is imported.
//
// **A ceiling gives back what was measured.** Sections accumulate in one
// record that starts entirely `unmeasured / not_attempted`, and each stage
// fills its own members as it completes. A pass the ninety-second deadline
// cuts off mid-flight — where the ceiling wins the race and the body's own
// return value is discarded — still stores everything the stages before it
// measured, and everything outstanding stays `not_attempted`. Never a 0: a
// zero is a measurement about a customer's site, and nobody made it.
//
// **Degradation never throws.** A callee that raises — a vendor that
// answered with something unreadable, a model that did not answer — is
// caught at its own stage and becomes `undeterminable`, which is what is
// true of it; the pass continues and the report is stored. A pass reaches
// `failed` only where it produced no report at all: a domain that does not
// parse, or a free call with no claimed slot to adopt.
//
// **A free re-scan of the same domain within seven days serves the stored
// report** (§6.4) — no new spend and no vendor call, the stored report's
// own scan id returned. The adopted row is closed out at zero cents, so
// the next visitor is not refused for an in-flight scan that is not
// running. A correction is not a re-scan: it re-measures inside the scan
// it corrects and always runs.
