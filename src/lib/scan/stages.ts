// src/lib/scan/stages.ts — BP-023 `## Public interface`, WO-281
// (consolidates WO-060; see `archive/sdlc-factory-2026-09-04/corpus/docs/work-orders/WO-281.md`
// `## Consolidation`)
//
// Six named handles, one per dataset boundary of `BUILD.md` §6.3's
// free-scan list (BP-023 decision 7), and the stream that carries their
// transitions — plus a heartbeat and exactly one `ending` — to whoever
// calls `progress(scanId)`. No word a visitor reads appears in this file:
// every handle is internal (BP-019 turns a handle into a sentence,
// `## Out of scope`).
//
// **The producer side, and a gap flagged once (constitution rule 4.2).**
// BP-023's own `## Public interface` documents only the *reader* side of
// this module — `StageName`, `STAGES`, `StageEvent`, `progress` — and
// names no function a driver calls to report a transition. No table in
// this corpus's schema records one either (`BP-023 ## Data model delta`
// adds three admission columns and nothing about stages; `BP-012 ##
// Data model delta` adds `is_current`/`supersedes_scan_id`/
// `correction_state`/`stopped_reason` and nothing about stages either) —
// so `progress()` cannot be "an async iterable over the scan's recorded
// stage transitions" (WO-281 `## Steps` step 9) by reading a row anywhere.
// `driving the stages` is BP-012's `runScan`, explicitly out of this WO's
// scope and not yet built, so no real caller exists today to confirm a
// shape against. This file therefore adds a minimal, internal producer
// API — `enterStage`, `exitStage`, `emitEnding`, all below — as an
// in-process, per-`scanId` event bus (module-scoped, rule 1.1: an internal
// module boundary, the implementer's to choose). Its own tests drive it
// directly, standing in for the not-yet-built driver. Two consequences
// worth a future reader's attention, neither discharged here: (a) this
// only carries events within one Node process, so if the job that runs
// `runScan` and the process that serves this route are ever different
// deployed instances, a second transport (Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY, a
// queue) replaces this bus without changing `progress`'s own exported
// shape; (b) a scan whose stream nobody ever reads to completion leaves
// its entry in `streams` for the life of the process — no retention
// policy exists yet, and none is asked for by any row this WO's test plan
// carries.
//
// **Why `dbAdmin()` appears here at all** (this file's own `##
// Interfaces` block names it as consumed): the one thing the in-process
// bus above cannot answer is "does this `scanId` exist at all" for a
// subscriber that arrives with nothing yet published — an unknown or
// malformed id (WO-281 `## Steps` step 19) must not simply hang waiting
// for an event that will never come. `progress()` checks `scans` once, at
// subscribe time; a known scan yields whatever the bus already holds plus
// whatever it publishes live; an unknown one yields nothing at all, which
// `route.ts` (WO-063's half of this WO) reads as "respond 404" without
// itself touching a database.
