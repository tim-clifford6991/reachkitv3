// src/lib/scan/ceilings.ts — BP-023 `## Public interface`, WO-281
// (consolidates WO-059; see `sdlc-factory/docs/work-orders/WO-281.md`
// `## Consolidation`)
//
// **Read `decisions/ADR-021.md` first.** Two ceilings — 90 seconds
// (`TIMING.reportCeilingS`) and the free path's spend cap
// (`CAPS.FREE_C`, reached through BP-007's `CostContext.capHit()`) — and
// exactly one `Ending` however a free scan stops. Raising either ceiling
// at runtime, or computing a partial result from whatever a ceiling left
// measured, both read as kindnesses and both break a promise a customer
// can be shown (ADR-021). Nothing here does either: `withFreeBounds`
// exposes no third parameter, no environment escape and no per-scan
// exemption, and every source assertion this file's own test suite
// carries is satisfied by never spelling the four forbidden identifiers
// that WO-281's own test-plan table names.
//
// **Time is preemptive; money is cooperative.** The 90-second deadline can
// fire while `body` is stuck inside a call that never resolves — REQ-003
// criterion 5's "including when the delay is the scanned domain's own
// server answering slowly" — so `withFreeBounds` races `body` against a
// timer set to the deadline and returns at whichever settles first
// (`runBounded`, below). The spend ceiling has no equivalent race: it can
// only change between discrete calls (BP-007's own re-check discipline —
// `capHit()` is "re-checked between calls in any multi-call step"), so it
// is read cooperatively through `Bounds.stopNow()`/`capHit()` wherever the
// caller chooses to ask, never preempted from outside. Time is checked
// first when both apply in the same tick (WO-281 `## Steps` step 3),
// because `TIMING.reportCeilingS` is the bound REQ-003 criterion 5 states
// absolutely.
//
// **How `Bounds.capHit()` reaches a real `CostContext`.** BP-023's own
// `## Public interface` locks `withFreeBounds` to two parameters — `a` and
// `body` — with no third slot for one (`withFreeBounds.length === 2` is
// itself one of this WO's test-plan assertions), yet this file's
// `## Interfaces` block also names `withCostContext` as consumed. The only
// reading that satisfies both without inventing a hidden channel is that
// `withFreeBounds` opens the context itself, scoped to the same call: it
// wraps `body` inside `withCostContext({ scanId, cap: 'FREE', policyVersion
// }, ...)` and wires `Bounds.capHit()` to that inner context's own
// `capHit()`. `cap: 'FREE'` is derivable from the function's own name — the
// free path's bounds — without asking anyone. `policyVersion` is not: nothing
// upstream of this file pins one, so it is chosen here (rule 1.1, recorded
// once): `FREE_SCAN_POLICY_VERSION` below. `structure.md` rule 5's bar —
// "a number that appears in two files is wrong" — does not reach a value
// that lives in exactly one file, which this stays as long as no second
// caller repeats the literal rather than importing it.
