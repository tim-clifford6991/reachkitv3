// src/lib/costs/ledger.ts — BP-007's write half (WO-022, folded into WO-276)
//
// `recordFetch`'s write half (`index.ts`): a row is written for every call
// that reached the vendor, including one that succeeded at the vendor and
// failed on parse (BP-007 `## Error & edge behavior`) — this module's job
// ends the moment it has written the row; what the caller does with the
// payload afterwards is not its concern. Every row carries both figures —
// `reserved_cents` (what the cap was checked against) and `cost_cents`
// (the settled figure where one settled, the reservation otherwise,
// ADR-094 decision 3a) — this module writes exactly the two numbers it is
// given; the reservation/settlement/clamp arithmetic is `index.ts`'s
// (BP-007's own file-plan split).
//
// **Schema-typing gap, flagged once here (constitution rule 4.2), same
// class `src/lib/scan/admission.ts` already names and works around:**
// `fetches` is this node's own table (BP-007 `code:
// supabase/migrations/*_fetches*.sql`), created by this WO's own
// migration, but `src/lib/db/types.generated.ts` is BP-002's generated
// artifact — outside this work order's file plan (`supabase/migrations/`,
// `src/lib/costs/`, `tests/costs/` only) and stale even against the
// applied baseline+RLS schema by that file's own header note.
// Regenerating it is a later, cross-boundary pass, not this WO's. This
// module therefore declares `FetchesRow` locally and reaches the table
// through a narrow, explicitly cast query-builder subset
// (`untypedFetches`) — the same `untyped()` escape hatch shape
// `src/lib/scan/admission.ts` uses for its own two schema gaps — rather
// than widening the generated `Database` type or losing typing on every
// other table `dbAdmin()` reaches.
