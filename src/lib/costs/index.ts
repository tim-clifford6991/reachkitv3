// src/lib/costs/index.ts — BP-007's public interface (WO-022, folded into
// WO-276), verbatim from `## Public interface`.
//
// `withCostContext()` opens the context, runs `body`, and at close writes
// the roll-up (`spentCents()`, `degraded()`) to `scans.cost_cents` and
// `scans.status` (BP-007 `## NFR budget`). `recordFetch` is cache-first,
// ledger-always (`cache.ts`, `ledger.ts`): a cache hit costs nothing and
// touches neither the cap nor the ledger; a miss **reserves** `costCents`
// before `run()` — the cap is checked against the reservation, never a
// figure that does not exist yet — and, where the call site supplies
// `settleCents`, **settles** the ledgered figure from the response
// afterwards, clamped to the reservation (ADR-094 decision 3a, BP-007
// decision 4).
//
// **Sequential-calls assumption (rule 1.1 — parameter, recorded once
// here).** `capHit()`'s own contract — "re-checked between calls in any
// multi-call step" — and every multi-call example in BP-007 describe a
// caller `await`ing one `recordFetch` at a time inside a loop, never
// several run concurrently (e.g. via `Promise.all`). This implementation
// tracks one in-flight reservation at a time on that assumption; a caller
// that fans multiple `recordFetch` calls out concurrently would race that
// single slot. No call site in this WO's scope does — BP-008/BP-009's
// callers are this seam's, out of scope here — and enforcing mutual
// exclusion defensively (a queue, a lock) is not asked for by any test
// row and is not added speculatively. Reversal cost if this assumption
// stops holding: replace the single `inFlightReserved` number with a set
// of concurrent reservations, summed — a change local to this file.
