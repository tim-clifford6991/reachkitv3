// src/lib/costs/cache.ts — BP-007's cache read (WO-022, folded into WO-276)
//
// Keyed `source + cacheKey + policyVersion` (BP-007 `## Error & edge
// behavior`). A cache read is the newest row on that key inserted within
// `freshnessDays`, **excluding a row whose payload is the vendor's own
// zero-result shape** (BP-007 decision 3 — "the exclusion is at the read,
// not the write"): an empty payload is always a miss, retried and
// ledgered again on the next scan, and never served back as a hit. Bumping
// `policyVersion` is how a changed derivation invalidates its cache;
// nothing is ever deleted here or anywhere else in this seam.
//
// **Genericity (rule 1.1 — parameter, recorded here since BP-007 states
// the *shape* — "an empty array or an explicit no-match marker the parser
// already produces" — but not a closed rule this seam can encode without
// learning a vendor's payload format, which WO-276's own dispatch forbids
// ("this seam learns nothing about AI Overviews or any vendor").** The
// only shape every vendor's parser can be expected to agree on without
// this seam knowing anything vendor-specific is: `null`/`undefined`, or an
// empty array. A vendor whose own "no match" marker is some other shape
// (an object, a sentinel string) normalises it to one of these two before
// the payload reaches `recordFetch` — that normalisation is the call
// site's (BP-008's, BP-009's), the same way `settleCents`'s vendor rule
// stays at the call site (BP-007 decision 4). Reversal cost: change one
// function (`isEmptyPayload`, below); no schema or interface change.
