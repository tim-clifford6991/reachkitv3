// The trichotomy REQ-004 makes a customer promise. Every stored number and
// every rendered number in the product is one of these three arms: a real
// value, a real value that happens to be zero, or an admission that the
// scan could not produce one — and why. There is no fourth arm and no
// escape hatch that lets a caller manufacture a value from nothing
// (REQ-004 criterion 12).
//
// `Measured<T>` is a plain discriminated union — not a class, no methods,
// no prototype (BP-024's NFR budget: "a per-value allocation and nothing
// more").

/** Total: never throws, never calls `f` when any part is `unmeasured`.
 *
 *  - Any part `unmeasured` → `unmeasured`, carrying the fold of every
 *    unmeasured part's reason under `worseReason` (REQ-004 c6, c9).
 *  - Otherwise, `f` is applied to the parts' values. The result's own kind
 *    is `zero` only when every part was `zero`; a single `measured` part
 *    among zeros makes the whole `measured` — real information entered,
 *    "a zero is a value" but not the identity that swallows one (WO-052's
 *    own test row deliberately leaves this a two-way choice; this is the
 *    parameter, rule 1.1, chosen here and recorded once).
 *  - `at` is taken from the first part. Every caller in this module passes
 *    parts that already share one `at` (one scan's `measuredAt`, enforced
 *    downstream by `verdict.ts`'s own consistency assertion), so any part's
 *    `at` would do; the first is simplest. `combine` itself never
 *    validates that invariant — it is total and does not throw. */
