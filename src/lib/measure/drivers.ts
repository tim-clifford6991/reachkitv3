// BUILD §5
// src/lib/measure/drivers.ts — the four measured quantities, as four pure
// functions. BUILD §5's formulas are the whole of the arithmetic: no
// fetch, no vendor call, no clock (`at` is always the caller's), no
// persistence. Every function returns `Measured<number>` and no branch
// reaches a number out of an `unmeasured` arm — a driver that could not be
// measured is `unmeasured` (rendered "—"), a measured 0 is the `zero` arm,
// and an empty denominator reads 0, never null.
//
// The coefficients that BUILD §5 states as numbers of formula *shape*
// (25, 0.55, 0.45, 4, 0.4, 0.6, the "/ 3") live here beside the sentence
// they transcribe. The two that are pins — the direct-answer window and
// the answerability floor — are read from `SCORING`; the closed reader
// list is `AI_READER_AGENTS`. Nothing here is customer-visible.
