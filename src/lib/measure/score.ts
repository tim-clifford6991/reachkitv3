 *  **Provenance note (rule 1.1 — an internal module boundary, not a
 *  customer promise; recorded once, here):** BP-010's own `index.ts` does
 *  not exist in this repo yet — this WO's `depends-on` is
 *  `[WO-001, WO-006, WO-018, WO-051]`, none of which is BP-010's own leaf,
 *  and `## Out of scope` names "the `Drivers` themselves … another
 *  node's" explicitly. `factorsOf` and `verdictOf` still need the shape to
 *  type against, so it is declared here, verbatim from BP-024's own
 *  approved `## Public interface` transcription of BP-010's declaration —
 *  nothing invented (rule 1.2). TypeScript's structural typing means a
 *  real `Drivers` value BP-010's own `measureDomain` produces later will
 *  satisfy this type without either file importing the other; when
 *  BP-010's `index.ts` lands, this local declaration should be replaced by
 *  `import type { Drivers } from './index'` — a one-line, no-behaviour-
 *  change reversal. Flagged once here per constitution rule 4.2. */
