// BUILD §5
// src/lib/measure/own-fetch.ts — the one shape an own-document read takes
// in the `fetches` ledger (BUILD §6.5: "one `fetches` table is ledger +
// cache + raw store"). `measureDomain` (`index.ts`) writes it through
// `recordFetch`; `readMeasuredText` (`text.ts`) reads it back. Declared
// in its own small module so neither of those two files imports the other.
//
// A stored document is the JSON-safe projection of `FetchOutcome`'s `ok`
// arm — `readAt` as an ISO string, because `jsonb` has no Date. A failed
// read is never stored under this shape: `index.ts` returns `null` from
// the `run` closure on `ok: false`, which BP-007's cache treats as the
// zero-result shape ("an empty payload is always a miss; no negative
// cache", BUILD §6.4) — so a timeout today never becomes "timeout" for the
// rest of the cache window.
