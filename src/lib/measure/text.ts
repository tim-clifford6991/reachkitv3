// BUILD §5
// src/lib/measure/text.ts — `readMeasuredText`: the rendered text of every
// page the engine measured for a site, read back from the `fetches` rows
// `measureDomain` ledgered (BUILD §6.5: "one `fetches` table is ledger +
// cache + raw store"). The generation engine's comparison set — without a
// second read of the customer's own server at draft time, and without a
// second copy of the text anywhere.
//
// **It fetches nothing and stores nothing.** No `safeFetch`, no vendor
// call, no write. The extractor is `parse.ts`'s `visibleText`, imported —
// the same one the measurement itself used, so the text handed to
// generation cannot disagree with the text the page was scored on.
//
// The horizon is the site's own scans: a site with no scans returns `[]`
// — a legitimate empty, not an error. A scan whose own-document read was
// served from cache ledgered no row of its own (a cache hit spends
// nothing, so there is nothing to ledger), and so contributes no text here
// — the bytes it read are the row the earlier scan wrote.
