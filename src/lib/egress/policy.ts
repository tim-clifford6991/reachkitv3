// src/lib/egress/policy.ts — WO-018, BP-006 `## Error & edge behavior`:
// "Refuses by policy, before any connection: private, loopback, link-local,
// multicast and reserved address space; non-http(s) schemes; redirects that
// leave the policy (each hop re-checked); ports other than 80/443."
//
// Every function here is pure and needs no network access: `checkSchemeAndPort`
// decides from the URL alone (no DNS needed, so it runs before any lookup),
// and `checkAddress` decides from an already-resolved IP literal. `safe-fetch.ts`
// calls both, once per hop, and never connects when either refuses.
//
// **Address-class boundaries are chosen here as a parameter (rule 1.1).**
// BP-006 names five classes by name — "private, loopback, link-local,
// multicast and reserved" — without enumerating CIDR ranges, so the exact
// numeric edges are an implementation choice, not a customer promise.
// IPv4 ranges below are IANA's special-purpose address registry (RFC 6890);
// IPv6 ranges are RFC 4291 (loopback/link-local/multicast), RFC 4193
// (unique-local, classed here as "private"), RFC 3849 (documentation) and
// RFC 6052 (NAT64 well-known prefix). Built on `node:net`'s `BlockList`
// (stable since Node 15) rather than hand-rolled CIDR arithmetic — a
// narrower, already-audited primitive for exactly this membership question.
// Reversal cost: low — every range lives in the two tables below, in this
// file only, with no customer-visible consequence; only the set of
// addresses refused moves, never a promise this product makes.
//
// An IPv4-mapped IPv6 literal (`::ffff:a.b.c.d`) is still refused when its
// embedded IPv4 address is blocked — `RANGES` below adds both families'
// subnets into one `BlockList` per class, and `BlockList.check(ip, "ipv6")`
// resolves that literal against the IPv4 subnets in the same list on its
// own (verified directly against `node:net`, no unwrap needed or present
// here — TST-027: an earlier hand-rolled unwrap-and-reclassify step was
// dead code credited with a guarantee `BlockList` already provided, which
// is a worse defect than no code in a security module. The test asserting
// the outcome stays; see `tests/egress/policy.test.ts`).
