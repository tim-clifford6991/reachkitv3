// src/lib/market/views.ts — BUILD §6.6
//
// The narrow structural reads the pure market leaves take from shapes
// another leaf owns. Nothing here is a second declaration of one of those
// shapes (rule 2.4): each interface below is a *subset* of the fields the
// owning leaf declares, so the owner's real value satisfies it
// structurally, with no import and no conversion at the call site.
//
// Why the subsets exist at all. `deriveRivals`, `buildPresenceCard`,
// `buildAiAnswersCard` and `checkCoherence` count over SERPs the scan has
// already bought — §6.6's "Zero extra cost". That promise is held
// structurally: none of those modules resolves an import into
// `src/lib/vendors/`, `src/lib/costs/` or `src/lib/llm/`, so none of them
// has a function to call that could spend anything, and their tests assert
// exactly that over the module source. A type-only import of the vendor's
// `SerpResult` would be erased before the bundle exists and could not
// itself buy anything, but it would put the import path back into the
// files whose absence is the proof — so the shape is restated here, once,
// rather than four times inside four leaves.
//
// `src/lib/market/coherence/check.ts` declared its own copy of the
// organic-only view and flagged the duplication for the architect to
// resolve here; `MarketSerpOrganic` is that resolution, and that file now
// reads this one.
//
// `SelectedSearchView` and `QuestionView` are the same arrangement for the
// two shapes `src/lib/market/questions/{select,phrase}.ts` will declare
// (ADR-095, BP-025's `SelectedSearch` and `Question`, issue #26): the card
// builders here read a search's keyword and volume and a question's
// wording, id and phrasing, and nothing else of either. When those files
// land, their values satisfy these views unchanged.
