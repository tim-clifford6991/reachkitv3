//
// Three verdicts, not two: `coherent`, `incoherent`, `unjudgeable` — never
// two. Below `COHERENCE.minMeasuredSearches` (3) the check has no input:
// with fewer than three measured top-tens no domain can reach the
// threshold whatever they contain, so a coherent and an incoherent market
// would produce the identical result. `unjudgeable` says so instead of
// guessing — REQ-094 criterion 2's promise, and this WO's whole reason to
// exist (BP-028 `## Error & edge behavior`).
//
// The threshold is a pinned *expression*, never a pinned number
// (BP-028 decision 1: "The threshold is a pinned expression, not a pinned
// number"). Neither `2` nor `4` appears as a literal in this file
// (`structure.md` rule 5) — both operands are read from `COHERENCE`.
