// src/lib/market/rivals/domains.ts — BP-026
//
// WO-077. The product's one answer to "what domain is this", "is it a
// platform" and "is it the customer's own", so a customer's own hosted page
// can never become their own rival (BP-026 `## Error & edge behavior`).
// Three pure, total functions — no network, no DNS, no clock, no throw.
//
// Rule 7.2 reuse: `registrableDomain` calls `parseDomain` (WO-051,
// `src/lib/scan/domain.ts`) for every step that function already owns —
// lower-casing, scheme/userinfo/port/path/query stripping, trailing-dot
// stripping, IP-literal rejection, IDN-to-punycode, and the listed-public-
// suffix check. `parseDomain`'s `CanonicalDomain` deliberately keeps
// subdomains other than `www.` (WO-051's own contract: `content.` stays
// `content.` there), so it is not by itself this file's eTLD+1. The one
// step this file adds is the eTLD+1 reduction `parseDomain` does not do:
// a second `psl.parse` call on the already-validated, already-normalised
// host, reading its `domain` field (`psl`'s eTLD+1, e.g.
// `content.example.co.uk` -> `example.co.uk`, never `co.uk` — verified
// against `psl`'s own behaviour, not hand-rolled). This is not a second
// implementation of `parseDomain` (rule 7.1): `psl` is already `domain.ts`'s
// own dependency and this file calls it for exactly the one field
// `domain.ts` does not expose.

 *  the single label immediately before the public suffix — `"example"` in
 *  `example.co.uk`, always dot-free, so `registrableDomain(...).split(".")[0]`
 *  reads it without a second `psl` call). This is a parameter this file
 *  chooses under constitution rule 1.1, not a customer promise: the
 *  membership *set* is BP-005's pin, transcribed and cited above, never
 *  restated here; only the *matching granularity* — sld-only rather than
 *  full eTLD+1 — is this file's own choice, forced by the set being
 *  recorded without TLDs. Reversal cost: low — it changes only which
 *  domains under an unlisted TLD false-positive-match a platform name
 *  (e.g. a hypothetical `reddit.io` would match `"reddit"`); no test in
 *  this WO's plan depends on the distinction, and no customer promise
 *  reads this file's granularity rather than the set itself. */
