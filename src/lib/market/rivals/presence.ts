// src/lib/market/rivals/presence.ts — BUILD §6.6, the Google-presence card
//
// One denominator: the searches this report actually measured. The
// customer's occupancy and every rival's are counted over exactly that
// subset, so a card whose customer is at zero still says something true
// against the same number every rival is read against — §6.6's cold-start
// rule for this surface: "0 is shown as a measurement, never an error",
// and never a ratio.
//
// **The honesty bound of this card is the absence of a place to put a
// violation, not a review.** `PresenceCard` has no field for a rival's
// ranked count, size, band, revenue, traffic value, funding, headcount or
// projected return, and no field a severity, warning or problem level
// could be written into. §6.4's never-pull list forbids the measurement
// that would make such a claim true on the free path, and this module
// buys nothing at all: it resolves no import into `src/lib/vendors/`,
// `src/lib/costs/` or `src/lib/llm/`, takes no cost context and takes no
// locale — every figure on it comes from calls made at the one pinned
// `SERP_LOCATION`, which the vendor client exposes no way to vary.
//
// No sentence is written here. `framing` is a state; the words that state
// picks are the copy registry's and the report surface's.
