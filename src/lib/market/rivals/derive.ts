// src/lib/market/rivals/derive.ts — BUILD §6.6, zero extra cost
//
// The market decides who the rivals are; the customer's own rankings never
// enter. §6.6's cold-start law is held here by construction rather than by
// a branch: this function reads twelve SERPs and an own-domain string, and
// there is no argument through which a customer's ranked count, presence
// or history could reach it. The output is identical whether the customer
// ranks for 10,000 searches or for none — the property the cold-start test
// pins directly.
//
// **This module buys nothing.** §6.6: "Zero extra cost — it counts over
// SERPs already bought." It resolves no import into `src/lib/vendors/`,
// `src/lib/costs/` or `src/lib/llm/` and takes no cost context, so there
// is no call here that could spend; `tests/market/rivals/derive.test.ts`
// asserts that over this file's source.
//
// Domain normalisation, the platform partition and the own-domain test are
// all `./domains`' — one implementation in the product, not two.
