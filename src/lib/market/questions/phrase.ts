// BUILD §6.7 step 4 — phrase the selected searches as questions (issue #26; WO-075's plan)
//
// "Template-first … the LLM only words the question. **Phrasing never changes
// which searches were selected**." Two things make that structural rather
// than aspirational:
//
//   1. `Question.search` is carried by reference from the selection. Nothing
//      here reads it, rewrites it, or lets the model supply one.
//   2. The schema this call parses admits `{ id, text }` and nothing else, so
//      a model that returns a keyword has produced an **unparseable
//      response**, not a re-selection — and an unparseable response is
//      `llm()`'s own `unmeasured`, which degrades to the template below.
//
// **This is the free path's second nano call, and that is deliberate.** BUILD
// §6.7 step 4 reads "nano, same call as step 1", which is arithmetically
// impossible: deterministic selection sits between step 1 and step 4, so this
// call's input does not exist when the profile call is issued. BP-025
// decision 2 settles it at two nano calls, ≈0.6¢ against a 12¢ cap. Folding
// them back into one would let the model see the candidate set before
// selection runs — exactly the coupling §6.7 forbids.
//
// **A failed phrasing degrades, it never drops.** The returned array is
// always exactly as long as the selection handed in: a missing question would
// silently change the denominator every other number on the AI-answers card
// is read against. `phrasing` records which of the two produced each wording.
//
// **Cold-start law (§6.6).** An empty selection is a complete result —
// `zero` with `[]`, and no model call, because there is nothing to word.
//
// The template forms are mechanical transforms of the keyword — BUILD §6.7
// step 4's own "best X" / "X vs Y" shapes — not sentences the product speaks
// in its own voice, so no copy key is minted here (BP-025 decision 3).

 *
 *   - one question per keyword, standing for that search and no other —
 *     §6.7 step 4 ("the LLM only words the question"); REQ-006 c13 /
 *     REQ-007 c6 (the wording never changes which search it stands for);
 *   - in a buyer's own words, as asked of an AI assistant — §6.7 step 1's
 *     "buyer vocabulary"; REQ-006's "what AI tells buyers";
 *   - no brand, product or company the keyword does not itself name, and no
 *     "best" / "top" it does not carry — either would make it a different
 *     search (§6.7 step 3's own-brand drop and intent shapes; step 4,
 *     "phrasing never changes which searches were selected"). A keyword that
 *     names brands ("X vs Y") keeps them, as step 4's own template does;
 *   - one sentence ending in a question mark — step 4's template forms;
 *   - the market's language — `SERP_LOCATION` (§6.3a, US English today).

 *  No REQ fixes the question mark, so `PHRASING_SCHEMA` does not enforce it:
