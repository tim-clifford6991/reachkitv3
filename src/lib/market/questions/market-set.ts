// BUILD §6.7 step 2 — the measured market set (issue #26; WO-072's plan)
//
// "**Step 2 — Measured market (1.8¢).** `keyword_suggestions` on the primary
// seed → ~50 real searches with real volumes. This converts guessed language
// into measured language."
//
// This module buys and nothing else. It applies **no** floor, no filter, no
// ranking, no intent classification and no near-duplicate collapse — those
// are `select.ts`'s, pinned there, so there is exactly one place a search can
// be dropped (BP-025 decision 1 keeps selection pure and in one place). The
// only collapse here is transport-level: an exact repeated `keyword` across
// two seeds is one row, kept at its first occurrence.
//
// **Cold-start law (§6.6).** A vendor that returned no rows is `zero`
// with `[]` — a measurement, never an error and never `unmeasured`. No row is
// ever synthesised to make the market look inhabited, so a domain that ranks
// for nothing completes this step with a real, empty answer.
//
// Cache-first is the seam's, not this file's: `keywordSuggestions` runs inside
// `CostContext.recordFetch` (§6.5), which serves the 30-day suggestions
// window from `fetches` before it spends (§6.4).

 * `CostContext` tracks one reservation at a time by contract.
 *
 * The arms fold as WO-072 step 3 states them: any `measured` arm makes the
 * whole set `measured` (real market language entered), all-`zero` is `zero`,
 * and a set with no rows and at least one failed seed is `unmeasured` — the
 * honest arm, since "we measured an empty market" is a claim the failed seed
 * does not support. Where more than one seed failed the reasons fold under
 * `worseReason` (BP-024 decision 3: `undeterminable` outranks
 * `not_attempted`), rather than taking the first arm's reason and letting the
 * seed order decide what the product claims.
