// BUILD §9 — the hosted destination adapter.
//
// §9's hosted CMS is `content.{customer-domain}` by CNAME to an edge route
// that serves static-rendered pages by Host header. That route is
// `src/app/(hosted)/**` and it lands with this file (#49), which is why
// this adapter now delivers where #131's stub refused.
//
// **It writes no external system, and that is the whole shape of it.** The
// page *is* the `publications` row: there is no second system to reconcile,
// no destination-side marker to leave (ADR-080 — the unique index alone is
// this adapter's at-most-once guarantee, and the marker exists only for
// WordPress), and no byte leaves the process. `deliver` composes the one
// address the page will be readable at, clears the edge's cache tags, and
// says what it did.
//
// **`madeLive` follows the delivery's own success**, never `servesPublicly`
// and never `kind`: a delivery that failed made nothing live, and
// `unpublish` reads that arm back off the row.
//
// The archived plan is WO-228.
