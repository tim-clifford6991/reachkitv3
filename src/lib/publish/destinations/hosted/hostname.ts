// SPEC §5 — the customer's own subdomain, from a typed label to a served
// host.
//
// §5's ruling of 2026-09-12: "on save the app adds the hostname to the
// project's domain list through the Vercel Domains API with our server-only
// token, the certificate is automatic once the CNAME resolves, and settings
// shows 'live' or 'waiting for DNS'." Three things have to happen in one
// order for that sentence to be true, and this module is where they are
// kept together: the host is stored on the destination row (by the one
// transaction that creates it), it is attached to the project, and the
// word the customer reads is written back.
//
// **Idempotent by asking, not by remembering.** Every entry point here can
// be called again for a host already attached: the vendor's own answer for
// a hostname this project holds is the same answer the first call got, so
// the setup submit, a later health check and a retry after a failure
// converge on one domain entry and never on two. The one thing remembered
// is *when the vendor was last asked*, which bounds the calls the scheduled
// health pass makes and decides nothing about the host.
//
// **It is not on the edge's path.** `store.ts` holds the Host lookup the
// hosted edge makes, and this module is imported only by the setup store
// and the health check — so nothing a middleware-reachable file imports
// reaches the vendor seam.
//
// **No sentence, and no vendor payload.** What a caller learns is a state
// with two members, which is what the customer reads two words for.

 * The scheduled health pass reaches this for every hosted destination, so
