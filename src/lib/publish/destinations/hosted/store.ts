// no payment, so it reads through `publishDb()` (the admin client) and
// **writes nothing at all**: nothing under `src/app/(hosted)/` can advance
// the state machine, and nothing here gives it a way to.
//
// **Two select lists and no third.** Every column named below is one the
// page, the sitemap or §9's page record needs; `sites.user_id`,
// `destinations.config` and every other credential-adjacent column is
// absent by construction rather than by care taken at the call site.
//
// **"Live" is one predicate, written once**: a `hosted` publication that
// has a `published_at` and no `unpublished_at`. The page render, the
// sitemap and the 410 all read it from here, so an unpublished page cannot
// be gone from one and present in another.
//
// The archived plans are WO-229 (the host resolution this feeds) and
// WO-230/WO-231 (the page and the sitemap).
