// BUILD §9 — the freshness promise, kept on the read path.
//
// The date the customer reads about a destination is never more than
// `DESTINATION_HEALTH_MAX_AGE_H` old, **whether or not a publish was
// attempted in between**. That promise is about the moment they read it,
// so it is kept where they read it: `listDestinations` calls this, and a
// stale row is re-checked in line before the list is returned.
//
// Refreshing only on publish would fail it exactly where it matters most —
// a destination breaks, publishing stops, so nothing attempts a publish,
// so nothing refreshes, and the customer reads a date from before the
// breakage. And a job would fail it in a second way: §11's kill
// switch stops `publish/execute` and `draft/generate`, and a stop must not
// take the truth of a date on a screen with it.
//
// The cost is that a read path can make a network call, which is why it is
// debounced and why at most one live destination per site exists to check.
