// BUILD §9 — health is a state, and this is what decides it.

// §9: "expired credential is a **state** (reconnect prompt, queue holds),
// not an error loop." A state has to be *found* by something, and this is
// that something: one check, one conclusion, one write.
//
// **It makes no write to the customer's site.** Every arm below is a read
// — a DNS resolution, or the adapter's own read of its end — so a health
// check running while a delivery is in flight cannot interfere with it,
// and a credential is never proved by creating something with it.
//
// **It writes `health_changed_at` only when the state actually changed.**
// That column is when the destination broke, not when it was last looked
// at, and one breakage mail is counted from it (`breakage-mail.ts`).

/**
 * What the hosted destination's state is.
 *
 * The record the customer has to point is the first question, and DNS
 * resolution answers it on its own: a name that does not resolve is a
 * record that was never set, and until it is, no page is delivered there
 * and none is recorded as live at that address.
 *
 * **The name it resolves is the one the customer chose** (SPEC §5,
 * 2026-09-12), read off the destination row. A row written before the
 * label became a choice carries none, and the default label is what it has
 * always been served at — so nothing here resolves a host with an empty
 * first label.
 *
 * **The hostname is attached to the project here too, and that is where
 * "idempotently" lives.** The submit attaches it once; this check attaches
 * it again — at most once an hour per host, the throttle `syncHostname`
 * keeps — so a founder whose save happened while the vendor was unreachable
 * is not left with a record pointing at a project that has never heard of
 * them. The word the customer reads is the domain list's own answer and is
 * decided there, never from the resolution below: a record can resolve
 * perfectly at a host this project was never told about, and that host
 * serves the platform's 404 rather than the customer's pages.
 *
 * A name that *does* resolve raises the one question resolution cannot
 * answer — whether it points at our edge or at somebody else's server —
 * and the adapter is asked, because the adapter is the end that would
 * know. It answers `ok`: the edge route serves (`src/app/(hosted)/`), and
 * `src/lib/publish/destinations/hosted/` is the end that answers for it.
 *
 * A site with no domain yet has nothing to point: that is `never_connected`
 * and not a failure of anybody's DNS.
