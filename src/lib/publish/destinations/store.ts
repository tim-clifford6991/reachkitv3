// BUILD §9 — the `destinations` rows, read and written in one place.
//
// Every read here names its columns and **none of them names `config`**.
// That is the mechanism behind §9's "credentials … never logged": the
// ciphertext is not absent from these selects by care taken at each call
// site, it is absent because there is one select list and it does not have
// it. `config/` is the only module that ever names the column, and the
// only thing it does with the value is hand it to one callback.
//
// A row is *live* when `deleted_at is null`. Disconnect keeps the row —
// published pages stay live and their publications point at it (ADR-080) —
// so every read a surface or a publish attempt makes filters on it, and
// the partial unique index means a site has at most one such row.
