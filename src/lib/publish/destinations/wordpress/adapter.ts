// BUILD §9 — the WordPress adapter: one create call that publishes live in
// the customer's own site, at most one post per (draft, destination).
//
// §9's WordPress clause reads "REST + application password, posts as draft
// + Yoast/RankMath meta when detected". The owner's ruling of 2026-09-01
// inverted the middle of it — `DECISIONS.md`, ADR-084: "Every CMS publishes
// live in one call" — and left the rest standing. So: REST, an application
// password, the SEO fields when detected, and a page that is publicly
// readable on the customer's own site from the moment the delivery
// completes.
//
// **The two booleans differ here, and this adapter is the reason there are
// two** (ADR-084 Decision 2). `servesPublicly: true` is what puts a live
// address on the publication row, which is what makes the 24-hour check and
// the weekly verdict reach this destination — by rules that already read
// the address and were not edited for it. `hostedByUs: false` is what keeps
// the `removed` unpublish arm hosted-only: without the split, the obvious
// reading of `servesPublicly === true` here is "so we can remove it", and
// unpublish would reach for a delete call against a site ReachKit does not
// own. Merging them fails two assertions in this module's test and nothing
// else in the product.
//
// **One create call, and the two-step is forbidden rather than merely
// unnecessary** (ADR-084 Decision 1). The natural WordPress sequence —
// create a draft, write the plugin fields, publish — opens a window in
// which a post sits in the customer's site as a draft ReachKit meant to
// publish, and a crash inside that window re-creates by accident exactly
// the population the ruling removes; the marker search, which answers "is
// this the post for draft X?", would then have to also answer "and did we
// finish?", the second job ADR-083 Decision 3 forbids loading onto a mark.
// The test asserts a request *count*, not a request *shape*, because a
// second write added later would otherwise read as a harmless follow-up.
//
// **`madeLive: true` and `liveUrl: string` are narrowed by type, and the
// narrowing has inverted.** Until 2026-09-01 this adapter would have
// narrowed them the other way to uphold a promise that a WordPress post is
// never made live by us. That promise is gone. Widening `madeLive` back to
// `boolean` is not a simplification: it is what would let a later edit
// report a delivery as published with nothing live behind it.
//
// **The marker is the second half of the at-most-once guarantee**
// (ADR-080). The unique index on `(draft_id, destination_id)` protects a
// table in our database; it cannot see inside a customer's WordPress. The
// case §9 names — a retry of an attempt whose outcome was never confirmed —
// is precisely the one where we called the destination, it created the
// post, and we lost the answer. The search for the marker is what makes
// that retry find the post instead of making a second one, and it looks for
// the marker and never for the stamp (`marks.ts`).
//
// **The stamp is asked about before it is written** (#160, ADR-083
// Decision 4). `canStamp` is a third read beside `health` and `canPublish`,
// answering a question neither of them does: whether this site will carry
// the `post_tag` term at all. It gates the one place this adapter would
// create a term in somebody's site, and the check records what it found on
// the destination row — so a customer is told where their posts are
// gathered from a fact, rather than finding out by following a mail to an
// empty filter. It is **not** a health input: a site that publishes and
// refuses the term is working.
//
// The archived plans are WO-237, WO-264.
