// BUILD §9 — the authenticated REST calls to a customer's own WordPress,
// and the one place the application password is in memory.
//
// Every byte leaving this module goes through `safeFetch` — SSRF-guarded,
// DNS-pinned, size-capped — and there is no other door: a `fetch(` here is
// a lint error and the assertion in `client.test.ts` reads this file's own
// source for one.
//
// **The application password exists for the duration of one call.** It
// arrives in the `WordPressConfig` the sealed-credential seam
// (`destinations/config`) hands the adapter, it is composed into one
// `Authorization` header, and nothing here logs it, returns it, throws with
// it or stores it. `safeFetch` logs five fields — host, reason, status,
// bytes, duration — and no header is among them, so §9's "never logged" is
// a property of the seam rather than care taken at each call site.
//
// **Robots checking is off, deliberately** (BP-048's stated rule 1.1
// choice). These are authenticated API calls to a site whose administrator
// gave us a credential for exactly this; `robots.txt` governs crawling, not
// an API the site's own owner authorised. Leaving it on would let a
// customer's own `Disallow: /` stop the publishing they are paying for.
//
// **This module classifies nothing.** Every call returns what the site did
// — an HTTP answer, or no answer at all — and `errors.ts` is the one place
// that turns either into a `FailureReason`. The vendor payload stops there.
//
// The archived plan is WO-236.
