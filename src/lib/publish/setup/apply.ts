// BUILD §4.3 — applySetupChoice(): two writes, one transaction, zero
// network calls, and never a fallback destination.
//
// §4.3's third card is "Mode + destination". Recording it is two rows: the
// publishing mode on the site, and the destination the founder chose. They
// commit together, in `apply_setup_choice` (see
// `supabase/migrations/20260906130000_sites_setup.sql`), because a founder
// who ends setup with a mode recorded and no destination — or a
// destination and no mode — is in a state no screen in this product
// describes and no later step repairs.
//
// **Zero network calls, and that is a budget, not an accident.** Nothing
// here resolves DNS, reaches a WordPress site, adds a domain to the
// project or checks a destination's health — the host the founder chose
// arrives as an argument, already decided. §4.3's footer is a founder pressing one control and the product
// starting; a DNS lookup on that path would put a third party's timeout
// between the press and the pass. `tests/publish/setup/apply.test.ts`
// asserts it with the egress seam stubbed to throw, so an edit that adds a
// check here fails a test rather than quietly slowing setup down.
//
// **The destination is created deferred, and that is not a fourth state.**
// `config` null and `health = 'expired'` is an ordinary broken
// destination, reached by the same reconnect path as any other. It is what
// lets "WordPress — connect later, ask me after the first page" (§4.3)
// complete setup with no credential collected, and what lets a founder who
// has pointed no DNS record finish setup and still get their first page —
// held as a draft they can read, by §9's own guard, not published
// somewhere else.
//
// **There is no fallback destination, because a fallback would be the
// bug.** The one thing a founder must be able to trust at setup is that
// their pages do not appear somewhere they did not choose. No branch here
// substitutes one kind for another, and `connected` is `false`
// unconditionally and by type: nothing is connected at setup, so no caller
// can be written that waits on one.
