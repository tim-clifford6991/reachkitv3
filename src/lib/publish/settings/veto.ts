// BUILD §4.7, §9 — the veto window's one conversion, in a leaf that reaches
// nothing.
//
// **Why its own file** (issue #374). WO-178 step 4 puts the days-to-hours
// arithmetic in exactly one module and forbids a second copy: "a second copy
// here is the copy that goes stale, and the pair already disagreed once."
// That rule is kept, and the module is this one — `settings.ts` imports it
// and re-exports both names, so every existing caller's spelling is
// unchanged and there is still exactly one implementation.
//
// What moved is only *reachability*. `settings.ts` imports `publishDb`, so
// evaluating it parses every deployment binding — and the settings screen
// renders the window as whole days, from a pure formatter that three of the
// screen's own tests import with no database anywhere. A leaf that holds a
// number and a division can be read by both sides; the writer's module
// cannot. It is ADR-092's idiom, applied for the same reason `model.ts`
// imports `pending.ts` by file rather than through its barrel.
//
// The column stores hours (`sites.veto_hours`, §10) and the stepper offers
// whole days (`VETO.minDays`…`VETO.maxDays`); these two functions are the
// whole of the difference between those facts.
