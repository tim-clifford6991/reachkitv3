// BUILD §9 — `publish()`: the delivery call after the claim, and the
// outcome written exactly as it happened.
//
// Three properties this file exists to keep, in order of how quietly they
// break:
//
//  1. **The adapter is called after the claim, never inside it.** The
//     `publications` row is written first (ADR-080) — it is what a crashed
//     attempt leaves behind for the next one to find — and only then does
//     anything leave the process.
//  2. **`made_live_by_us` is `result.madeLive` and nothing else.** Not
//     `servesPublicly`, not `hostedByUs`, not `liveUrl != null`, not
//     `kind === 'hosted'`. Those are facts about the *destination*;
//     `madeLive` is a fact about what this call did to this page, declared
//     by the adapter that did or did not do it (ADR-084 Decision 4).
//  3. **`verify_due_at` reads the address, never the kind.** A delivery
//     that came back with a live address is due for the 24-hour check;
//     one that did not is not. Deriving it from the destination kind is
//     how WordPress silently leaves the verified population.
//  4. **`seo_written` keeps "no answer" and "no plugin wrote" apart**
//     (issue #156). `undefined` on the result is a destination with no
//     such answer to give and stores `null`; an empty array is REQ-060
//     criterion 4's answer — delivered, and written into no plugin — and
//     stores `'{}'`. Written on this update and nowhere else: the fact
//     belongs to the delivery that learned it, and a claim that never
//     delivered leaves the column null.
//
// The outcome is written **as it happened**: a page that reached its
// destination is recorded delivered even if the switch was thrown
// mid-flight, and a page that did not is recorded failed. Neither is ever
// inferred from the switch — what the customer reads after switching off
// must never say nothing was published while a page went out, and never
// say a page went out that did not.
//
// The archived plan is WO-213.
