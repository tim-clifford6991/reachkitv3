// "Authorisation: default-deny. `src/app/(account)/**` requires a session;
// `src/app/(public)/**` explicitly declares itself public in one middleware
// allow-list, so a new account route cannot leak by omission." This file is
// the one allow-list. Every request under a segment this product serves is
// denied unless it matches `PUBLIC_PATHS` (BP-001 `## Public interface`,
// "Routes (public)"), one of the two transport-only adapters (`decision 1`:
// "every file under `src/app/api/**` is BP-001's ... a transport-only
// adapter"), the sign-in address prompt itself (below), or a Next.js
// internal.
//
// **A path under no segment this product serves is not denied — it does not
// exist** (#405). Denying it too meant a stranger who mistyped a ReachKit
// address was asked to sign in rather than told there is no page there,
// which is neither UI-SPEC S8 nor ruling 3a. `GUARDED_SEGMENTS` below is
// where that line is drawn, and why the default-deny property survives it.
//
// The authorisation check reads no database (`## File plan`). Since #468 it
// is not a cookie's presence either: a guarded request that carries a
// Supabase Auth session cookie is let through only once Supabase's
// `getUser()` has verified the token (`sessionOf` below), and a request
// with no such cookie is denied without any network at all. Session
// *identity* — which account, and whether it is tombstoned — stays
// `currentSession()`'s.
//
// **One database read was added here for one path (#104), and it is not
// the authorisation check.** A removed domain's report address must answer
// `410 Gone` (owner ruling 2026-09-05, #28) and a Next `page.tsx` cannot
// set a status, so `GET /scan/{domain}` — that path, that method, and
// nothing else — is rewritten to the route handler that can. See
// `removedRewrite` below for why it is here rather than in the page, and
// what it costs.
//
// **Deprecated file convention, flagged once (constitution rule 4.2).**
// Next.js 16 deprecates the `middleware.ts` / `export function middleware`
// convention in favour of `proxy.ts` / `export function proxy`
// (`node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/03-file-conventions/
// proxy.md`, "Migration to Proxy": "the term middleware ... is renamed to
// proxy"). "All functionality remains the same — only the file and export
// names have changed" (`middleware.md`), and `next/dist/build/index.js`
// still resolves `middleware.ts` and calls `middleware()` — it only
// `warnOnce`s at build time. WO-003's `## Interfaces` and BP-001's `code:`
// glob both name `src/middleware.ts` and `export function middleware`
// explicitly, and the glob is the architect's to change, not this
// implementer's — so this file follows the WO exactly, on the working half
// of a deprecated (not removed) convention, and the migration is left for
// a work order that touches BP-001's own `code:` list.

// ── Issue #331: the Content-Security-Policy, and the nonce it turns on ──
//
// **Why this file and not `next.config.ts`.** A nonce is worth having only
// if it is unpredictable and fresh per request; `headers()` in
// `next.config.ts` is evaluated once, for every request alike, so a nonce
// written there would be a published constant. Next's own guide mints it in
// the proxy for exactly that reason, and the renderer reads it back off the
// *request* header the proxy set — `parseRequestHeaders` in
// `next/dist/server/app-render/app-render.js` looks for
// `content-security-policy` among the incoming headers and extracts
// `'nonce-…'` from it. So this file sets the policy twice on each request:
// once onto the headers forwarded to the render (which is what makes Next
// stamp `nonce` on every script tag it emits) and once onto the response
// (which is what makes the browser enforce it). `next.config.ts` keeps the
// four headers that are the same on every request and reach the static
// bundles this file's `matcher` never sees.
//
// **Every response, including the ones that are not renders.** The sign-in
// redirect, the `410 Gone` rewrite and the hosted rewrite all leave through
// `sealed()` below, so there is no path out of this function that answers
// without the policy — which is what "present on every route" has to mean
// if it is to be worth asserting.
//

 * visitor stays at the address REQ-001 c2 promises them.
 *
 * **This is the one database read in this file, and it is narrow on
 * purpose.** It happens for `GET /scan/{domain}` and for no other path,
 * method or internal request; every other request is decided from the
 * allow-list and the cookie exactly as before, with no await on the way.
 * The read is one indexed lookup behind `isDomainRemoved`, over the table
 * that holds one row per written removal request. A read that cannot be
 * answered rewrites nothing — the report renders, which is this file's own
 * fail-open convention and the same one admission uses.
 *
 * `isDomainRemoved` is `src/lib/scan/removal.ts`', the product's one
 * reader of that table. It is imported from there and not through
 * `admission.ts`, which pulls `node:crypto` for its network-key HMAC — a
 * module the Edge runtime this file is built for does not have. This file
 * names neither the table nor a query:
 * the status a removed address serves and the refusal a removed domain's
 * scan gets can never disagree, because they are the same read.
