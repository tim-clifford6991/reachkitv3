// src/middleware.ts — BP-001 `## NFR budget`, WO-003
//
// "Authorisation: default-deny. `src/app/(account)/**` requires a session;
// `src/app/(public)/**` explicitly declares itself public in one middleware
// allow-list, so a new account route cannot leak by omission." This file is
// the one allow-list. Every request is denied unless it matches
// `PUBLIC_PATHS` (BP-001 `## Public interface`, "Routes (public)"), one of
// the two transport-only adapters (`decision 1`: "every file under
// `src/app/api/**` is BP-001's ... a transport-only adapter"), the sign-in
// address prompt itself (below), or a Next.js internal.
//
// Reads no database (`## File plan`): the check is a cookie's presence,
// nothing about its contents. Session *identity* is BP-061's
// `currentSession()`; the account container is not reachable before that
// node ships (`## Interfaces`).
//
// **Deprecated file convention, flagged once (constitution rule 4.2).**
// Next.js 16 deprecates the `middleware.ts` / `export function middleware`
// convention in favour of `proxy.ts` / `export function proxy`
// (`node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/03-file-conventions/
// proxy.md`, "Migration to Proxy": "the term middleware ... is renamed to
// proxy"). "All functionality remains the same — only the file and export
// names have changed" (`middleware.md`), and `next/dist/build/index.js`
// still resolves `middleware.ts` and calls `middleware()` — it only
// `warnOnce`s at build time. WO-003's `## Interfaces` and BP-001's `code:`
// glob both name `src/middleware.ts` and `export function middleware`
// explicitly, and the glob is the architect's to change, not this
// implementer's — so this file follows the WO exactly, on the working half
// of a deprecated (not removed) convention, and the migration is left for
// a work order that touches BP-001's own `code:` list.
