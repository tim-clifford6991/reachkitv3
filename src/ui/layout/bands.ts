// BP-018 `## Public interface`, "Layout (ADR-093)" — `BANDS`, `Band` and
// `Arm` transcribed verbatim (WO-269 file plan). `BAND_MIN` is this order's
// own: the lower bound of each band, in CSS px. `design/tokens.md` §2b is
// the one home for the two breakpoint values (rule 2.4); the three numbers
// below transcribe it and ADR-093 decision 2 (WO-269 rests-on row 3), and
// the conformance suite (`tests/ui/layout/layout.test.ts`) pins them back
// against `:root`'s declared custom properties so the transcription and the
// CSS declaration cannot silently diverge (the `tests/pins.test.ts` shape,
// structure.md rule 5).
