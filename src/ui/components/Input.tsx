// BUILD §2.2 — daisyUI `input`.
// src/ui/components/Input.tsx
//
// `components.md` §1, verbatim: "`input`. Placeholder **and** label
// required, never defaulted" | "default · invalid (one written line, value
// intact) · disabled".
//
// `label` and `placeholder` are both required with no default (BP-018
// decision 2). `invalid` is a discriminated union: passing `invalid: true`
// requires `invalidMessage` (the one written line) in the same object —
// there is no call shape that marks a field invalid without also supplying
// the sentence explaining why. The invalid value stays intact: this
// component never clears `value` itself.
//
// `name` — optional, added by WO-070 (constitution rule 1.1: an internal,
// additive, backward-compatible parameter; every existing caller keeps
// omitting it and renders exactly as before, no native `name` attribute).
// WO-070's own plan needed a plain HTML form's field to survive a
// no-JavaScript submit — the native mechanism a browser uses to include a
// field in `FormData`/`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` requires the
// control's own `name` attribute, and nothing at the page level can supply
// it after the fact once the control has rendered without one. Flagged
// once here (rule 4.2): this component's contract (`components.md` §1,
// BP-018 `## Public interface`) named no `name` prop, and the fix is this
// one-line, optional addition rather than a bespoke input or a second
// hidden control, which would have broken "exactly one input" (REQ-001 c1)
// or the no-JS path outright.
