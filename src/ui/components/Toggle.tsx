   *  drawn. The one caller is the sidebar's autopilot card, where the
   *  card's own eyebrow already states the mode: the switch beside it drew
   *  the same word a second time, which put "Autopilot" twice and a switch
   *  into a 222px column and overflowed it — the layout sweep's containment
   *  check is what caught it. The approved set draws that switch with no
   *  text of its own for the same reason (UI-SPEC S12: `aria-label` only).
   *
   *  A prop rather than a second component: §2.2's set of fifteen is
   *  closed, and this is the same widening `Progress` took for `onAccent`. */
