// BUILD §2.4 — the AI dot matrix
//
// §4.1 module 2, left card: "dot matrix over those m (rivals' cited rows
// filled gray, customer's row empty red-ringed, `n/{m}` per row; a
// no-AI-answer question = muted cell)". §4.5 tile 3 draws the same visual
// as an Overview tile with "dashed goal dots".
//
// **Three cell states, and a muted cell is never a miss.** §6.2: "render a
// no-AI-answer question as a muted cell, never as a miss." The type has
// three members for that reason — a boolean cannot hold three states, and
// merging `muted` into `not-cited` would count a question nobody was asked
// as a place the customer was ignored.
//
// **The goal dot is not a fourth cell state.** It is a marker drawn in the
// customer's row where a goal exists — the same kind of thing as the
// growth line's goal rule — so the cell vocabulary stays at three and no
// measurement is ever painted in `--chart-goal`.
//
// **The one status colour in the inventory is here, and it is on a
// state.** §4.1 fixes the customer's absent cells as red-ringed and §2.5
// permits exactly that: "Red appears only for *the customer's problem
// being shown to them*". No rival cell can reach it — the ring is selected
// by `identity`, which the caller sets to `you` for one row.
//
// The registry (`design/components.md`) plans this chart over a shared
// cell contract with a registered `AiDotMatrix` custom component. That
// component does not exist in this repository — the component barrel is
// closed at the fifteen daisyUI primitives — so the contract is declared
// here, once, and is the shape the report screen maps onto.
