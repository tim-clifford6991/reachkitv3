// BUILD §2.4 — the growth line
//
// §4.5 module 2: "searches-you-appear-in, weekly points, area+line in
// `--chart-you`, endpoint labelled, footnote pair … Hover tooltips."
// §6.6: "Growth chart starts at 0 and that is the story: the line leaving
// the floor" — a `0` is a measurement here, direct-labelled like every
// other point, never an error and never a missing mark.
//
// **Every point is labelled, not only the endpoint.** §2.4 ("every bar and
// point direct-labelled (name + value)") and §4.5 ("endpoint labelled")
// disagree; this takes the stricter of the two, which is the general rule.
// It is legible at the weekly points a quarter holds; a year of them is a
// question for whoever draws the Overview surface, not a value to guess
// here.
//
// **An unmeasured week is a break, never an interpolation.** The line is
// cut at that week, the week keeps its own place on the axis and its own
// label, and the caller must hand over the account of why — a series with
// a hole in it has no call shape without one. Nothing is carried forward:
// joining the week before to the week after would state a measurement that
// was never taken.
//
// **There is no empty frame.** `weeks` is a non-empty tuple, so "nothing
// measured yet" cannot be drawn as axes over nothing — that reads as a
// measurement of zero, which is a different claim. The caller renders its
// own written line in place of the chart.
