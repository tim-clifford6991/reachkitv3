// BUILD §2.4 — the chart bounds, written once
//
// §2.4 states its rules as bounds, not as single values: "One axis per
// chart, thin 2–2.5px lines, 3.5–5px endpoint dots with a surface-colored
// ring, faint gridlines at 2–3 values, hover tooltip on every mark
// (fixed-position, ink-on-bg, mono)" and "Inline SVG, hand-sized viewBoxes
// — no chart library."
//
// Every number below sits inside one of those bounds and every chart in
// this directory reads it from here, so the bounds are asserted once
// against the clause rather than five times against five transcriptions.
// These are the design system's own geometry, not product pins: they are
// layout parameters of five components and live with them, the same way
// the calendar grid's track rule lives with the calendar.
//
// **No CSS file, and that is deliberate.** §2.2 admits custom CSS for
// "chart SVGs", but a stylesheet has to be imported by the one root
// document, which is a shared file three in-flight branches are editing.
// The marks paint through SVG presentation attributes instead, and the one
// rule that cannot be an attribute — `:hover` — ships as a `<style>`
// element inside each `<svg>`.
