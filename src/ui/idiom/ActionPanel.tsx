// BUILD §2.2, §2.5 — the approved card idiom's tinted panel (issue #266).
// src/ui/idiom/ActionPanel.tsx
//
// design/tokens.md §9.1, verbatim: "**Anything asking the customer to act
// is a tinted panel** — `--accent-bg` or `--warn-bg`, a white icon chip, a
// bold title, one dim explanatory line, a pill CTA." It is the idiom's one
// genuinely new row (`components.md` §7, `proposed`), and it is **not** a
// daisyUI component: BUILD §2.2's set of fifteen is closed and this is not
// a sixteenth member of it, which is why it lives here and not in
// `src/ui/components/`'s barrel.
//
// TONE ADMITS `accent` AND `warn` ONLY. `--ok`/`--warn`/`--bad` are state
// colours (§2.5) and a panel is not a state, so `ok` and `bad` have no
// position here. The union below is what enforces it; the stylesheet alone
// could not.
//
// The three states are a discriminated union so that a panel cannot be
// asked for without the thing it needs: `default` and `in-flight` require
// the CTA's label, and `withheld` requires the one written line that says
// why the action is not offered — never a disabled control with no account.
//
// **The CTA may navigate, and then it is an `<a>`** (issue #353). Overview's
// two Needs-you panels take the customer to a draft and to the settings
// card; `Btn` is a `<button>` with an `onClick`, and a panel that posted
// nowhere would need client JavaScript to move. So `href` selects an anchor
// carrying the same classes the rank would have put on the button — the
// third instance of the "link that reads as a button" case the component
// registry already records two rows for, and it carries its own row.
//
// **The rank is the caller's** (issue #353). The set draws the veto panel's
// "Read it" as the solid primary and the reconnect panel's "Reconnect" as
// the outline secondary in accent: two calls to act, one screen, and §9.1
// gives the screen one solid fill. `rank` defaults to `primary`, so the
// panel keeps the single shape it shipped with wherever a caller says
// nothing.

 *  written line says why. The approved screen set draws the panel one more
 *  way, and it is none of those three — inside the landing's This-week card
 *  (UI-SPEC S1), where the panel is a **picture of the product** shown to a
 *  stranger. It carries no CTA there (the set draws none, and a solid
 *  accent CTA a visitor cannot use would be a third solid on a page ruling
 *  2b gives two) and no withheld account either, because nothing is being
 *  withheld from anyone: the panel is showing what the product does, not
 *  refusing to do it.
 *
 *  `withheld` is deliberately not reused for it. That arm's whole guarantee
 *  is "a disabled button with no account is unbuildable", which it keeps by
 *  requiring the account — and making the account optional to fit this case
 *  would give the guarantee away on the two screens that do ask for action.
 *
