// src/jobs/types.ts — BUILD §11, ARCHITECTURE `src/jobs/**`
//
// The job-id union, closed at exactly seven members, and the
// platform-neutral shapes the registry is built from. Adding an id is a
// change to this file and to `tests/jobs/registry.test.ts`, which asserts
// the set — an eighth id cannot arrive by accident.
//
// `BUILD.md` §11's table names six jobs. `account/maintenance` is the
// seventh: the clock-triggered obligations no read path can serve (a
// payment awaiting sign-in, a payment with no account, a hosting-end
// notice, a hosting stop, an account due for purge) have no other trigger,
// and each is owned by the module that holds its rule — this tick only
// hands the subject back.
//
// Nothing here names the job platform. `client.ts` is the one file that
// does, so replacing the platform is that file plus one route.
