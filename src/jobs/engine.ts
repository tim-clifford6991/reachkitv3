// src/jobs/engine.ts — BUILD §11
//
// The seam between the seven job definitions and the engine. Every
// function here is the interface a job calls.
//
// **Every engine behind them is built** as of issue #229 — the last
// `TODO(engine)` was `scan/run`'s free arm, and it went not because an
// engine landed but because it was never an engine: the free tier does not
// come through this job at all (see `runScan` below). `EngineNotBuilt` and
// its `TODO(engine)` convention stay for the next engine that is genuinely
// owed; `tests/jobs/definitions.test.ts` asserts the list of unbuilt ids is
// empty, so one regressing to a stub puts its id back there and fails.
//
// **Nothing here fakes work.** A stub does not return a plausible empty
// list and it does not swallow the call: it throws, loudly and
// non-retriably in effect, so a deployment that triggers a job before its
// engine exists fails visibly instead of reporting a quiet success. The
// same rule covers a delivery that should not exist — see `NotAJobPath`,
// which is a different failure with a different name, because "this engine
// is missing" and "this event should never have been sent" are different
// things for whoever reads the dead-letter.
//
// This module reaches no database and no vendor of its own: where an
// engine exists it is imported and called. It is a declaration of what the
// engine exposes, never a second implementation of it — every body below is
// one call into a module that owns the rule, or a named refusal.

// ── The scan pipeline — BP-012, and the deep tier wired here (issue #36)
//
// The one pipeline, tier a parameter. `scanId` is the delivery's own
// idempotency handle, not an instruction to the pipeline: a free pass
// adopts the row admission already claimed and a paid one mints its own,
// both inside `runScan` itself. Nothing about a tier is decided here.
//
// **`scan/run` is the deep tier's job and no other's** (issue #229). This
// used to read as two unbuilt arms waiting on an engine; neither is. Both
// other tiers reach the same pipeline, and neither reaches it through here:
//
//   - **Free runs inline, on the request.** `POST /api/scan` imports
//     `@/lib/scan/run` and calls `runScan({ domain, tier: 'free' })`
//     directly, because §6.4 puts the free report at "≈60s live" with a
//     human waiting for it — an event queued for a worker is the one shape
//     that cannot keep that promise. Nothing anywhere sends a `scan/run`
//     event for a free tier, and `tests/jobs/definitions.test.ts` sweeps
//     `src/**` to keep it that way.
//
//   - **Weekly has its own trigger.** `weekly/refresh` is an hourly tick
//     gated on each site's own local Monday (ADR-060), and its claim on
//     `(site_id, week_start)` is what makes the measurement happen once a
//     week. A second door into the same pass — through an event keyed on
//     `scanId`, which that claim does not cover — would be a way around it.
//
// So the two arms are not unbuilt and never will be: they are **not job
// paths**, and they say so. `notAJobPath` throws rather than returning a
// degraded result, for the reason every stub in this file throws: a
// delivery that should not exist must fail visibly, not report a pass
// nobody ran. It is a different failure from `EngineNotBuilt` and carries
// a different name, so an operator reading a dead-letter can tell "this
// engine is missing" from "this event should never have been sent".
//
// (What was here before pointed the free arm at "#24's admission claim".
// #24 is closed and was the `llm()` seam; no admission issue exists, and
// admission is not what stands between the free tier and this job — the
// route is.)
//
// A deep pass takes `runDeepPass` rather than `runScan` directly, because
// onboarding needs two things the other tiers do not: the founder's stage
// written where the waiting screen can read it, and the release latch.
// Both are that module's; it is still one `runScan` call underneath.

// The seventh obligation on `draft/generate`'s daily per-site tick: a
// destination that has needed reconnecting for 24 hours whose customer has
// not signed in since it broke. It rides this job because the occasion is
// one where the customer has *not* come to a screen, so no read path can
// supply it — and because this is the same per-site loop that would
// otherwise be preparing the page that is now being held.
//
// The predicate, the once-per-breakage guard and the send are all
// `src/lib/publish/destinations/health/`'s; this wrapper holds no
// threshold and no condition of its own.

// Two calls into `src/lib/account/lifecycle/`, and no logic of their own.
// Imported at the call, on the same footing as the hosting four above: the
// module reaches `@/lib/db`, which parses the environment the moment it is
// imported, and a static import here would put a database client in every
// module graph this seam appears in.
//
// The due-work predicate is a stored date on an indexed column and the
// sweep is the one code path in this product that deletes a customer's
// rows; neither is a job's to hold. The tick's cadence
// (`MAINTENANCE_TICK_MINUTES`) is tighter than the promise
// (`ERASURE_DAYS`), so the boundary a customer was told about is decided
// by `purge_due_at` and never by when a tick happened to fire.
