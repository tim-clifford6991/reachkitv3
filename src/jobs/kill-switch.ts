// src/jobs/kill-switch.ts — BUILD §11 bounds
//
// `BUILD.md` §11: "kill switch env var stops scan+generate+publish". The
// scope is those three ids and no others — a stop that also held
// `publish/verify` would leave a published page unchecked, and a stop that
// held `account/maintenance` would hold a purge, withhold a hosting notice
// and strand a paid customer waiting for a sign-in link. Widening this set
// is the mutation `tests/jobs/kill-switch.test.ts` fails on.
//
// The switch is an environment binding an operator sets. Nothing here
// decides *when* it is engaged.
