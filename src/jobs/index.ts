// src/jobs/index.ts — BUILD §11
//
// The registry: a closed array of exactly the seven job definitions, and
// the handler set that serves them. The registry is closed on purpose — an
// open one, where a job registers itself, means the first job that forgets
// is the one with no kill switch and no cap. A definition not in `jobs` is
// unreachable over HTTP.
//
// This file names no platform and holds no job logic: it imports the seven
// definitions and hands them to `serveJobs()`.
