// "No job fans out across customers inside one invocation past a fixed
// concurrency; a slow site never starves the rest of Monday." The bound is
// `JOB_FAN_OUT_CONCURRENCY`; this is the loop that honours it.
//
// A worker that rejects does not cancel the fan-out — one site's failure
// is one site's failure, and the rest of Monday still runs. Results come
// back in the order the subjects were given, whatever order they finished.
