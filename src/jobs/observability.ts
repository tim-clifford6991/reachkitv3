// src/jobs/observability.ts — BUILD §11
//
// One structured line per invocation, carrying four fields — job id,
// subject id, outcome, duration — plus, for a `degraded` outcome, which
// step degraded. Nothing else is ever emitted: not the event payload, not
// a vendor response, not an error message. The allow-list below is the
// whole line, and `tests/jobs/registry.test.ts` fails on a fifth field.
//
// `console.log` is this module's log channel, the same one
// `src/lib/scan/admission.ts` uses for its own decisions. Reversal cost if
// a logging seam lands: one call site.
