// BUILD §4.4 — the shell reads the registry, and renders nothing the owner
// has not written.
//
// `copy()` throws on an owner-owed key by design (BP-020: "a key whose
// string the owner has not yet supplied lands here with `''` … `copy()`
// refuses to render it"). That is the right behaviour for a caller which
// can only have reached an unwritten key by mistake. The shell is not that
// caller: it renders on every app screen, in states whose sentences the
// owner has not supplied yet (REQ-040 c4's three unfilled `next-publish.*`
// lines, c6's and c7's domain-block lines), and a screen that throws is
// worse in every way than a screen that omits a line nobody has written.
//
// So this is the shell's one reader: the sentence when there is one, and
// `null` — a state the caller must handle, not a fallback string — when the
// owner still owes it. `COPY[key] === ''` is exactly how `OWNER_OWED` is
// derived in `registry.ts` ("a key is owner-owed exactly when its value is
// the empty string"), read through the module's public `COPY`, so the two
// cannot drift.
//
// It invents nothing and hides nothing: `tests/app/shell/frame.test.tsx`
// reports which of the shell's keys are owed today, so filling one is a
// visible change and forgetting one is not silence.
