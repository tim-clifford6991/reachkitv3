// BUILD §4.4 — the shell's facts, for a real signed-in account.
//
// The other half of `provider.ts`: what `readShell` assembles from when the
// account is a customer's rather than the reserved fixture account. Every
// value here is a projection of rows another block already wrote — this
// file measures nothing, buys nothing and **creates nothing**.
//
// Each fact and whose rows it comes from:
//
//   weeks / firstDueOn   §11's weekly measurement — `weeksAlreadyStamped`
//                        over this site's own Mondays, and `nextDueOn`
//   waiting              §9's `in_review` and `needs_attention` drafts
//   next / causes        §9's scheduled publish, the site's own switch,
//                        and the kill switch
//   stopped              §6.5 / §11's stop, through `stopCause`
//
// **A site with nothing yet reads empty, and that is the right answer.** A
// customer who signed in the day they paid has no measured week, no page
// waiting and no scheduled publish; §4.4's frame and ADR-061's arms are
// designed for exactly that, and the alternative — a fixture standing in —
// is what this issue exists to remove.
//
// **`capHit` is not read separately, and that is deliberate.** §6.5 records
// a spend ceiling by marking the scan `degraded` ("skip remaining optional
// work, mark scan `degraded`, never throw"), so the fact reaches this file
// through the last run's status rather than through a second ledger read
// that could disagree with it. `stopCause` still classifies it — as
// `step-failed` rather than `spend-ceiling` — and both render a stop; when
// a per-account cap-hit reader exists, this is the one call site to change.
