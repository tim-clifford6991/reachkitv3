// read — the domain, a week count that counts measured weeks only, the
// waiting count, and either the next publish time or the first-match reason
// there is none."
//
// `assembleShell` is pure: facts in, model out. The reading of those facts
// is `provider.ts`'s, and today it reads a fixture (issue #9 builds the
// shell on fixture data; the queries arrive with §11's weekly measurement
// (#41) and §9's publishing (#45)). Keeping the assembly pure is what lets
// every REQ-040 criterion be decided by a test with no database at all.
