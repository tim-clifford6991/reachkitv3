// measurement of that domain — and where the customer has changed the
// domain, the count starts again at the first measurement of the new domain
// … That number is never larger than the number of weeks in which the site
// was measured: a week that ran and measured something advances it, a week
// that produced no measurement at all … does not."

// Criterion 7: with no measurement yet, "no week count is stated and in its
// place the domain block carries one written line saying this domain has not
// been measured yet and naming the date its first measurement is due."
//
// So: distinct measured weeks, for the *current* domain, computed — never a
// stored counter (which a domain change would have to remember to reset) and
// never elapsed weeks (which overstate whenever a week produced nothing).
