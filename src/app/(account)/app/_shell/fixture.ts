// BUILD §4.4 — the shell's facts, as a fixture.
//
// Issue #9 builds the shell frame and its model on FIXTURE data behind the
// typed provider in `provider.ts`. Every field below is a stand-in for a
// read that does not exist yet, each naming the issue that will supply it:
//
//   weeks / firstDueOn  → §11 weekly measurement, `accountForWeek` (#41)
//   waiting             → §9 drafts in review / needing attention (#45)
//   next / causes       → §9 `becomesPublishable` (#45)
//   domain / timeZone / mode → §4.3 setup and §4.7 settings (#14, #18, #42)
//
// It is one exported constant, not a generator: a fixture that varied per
// call would make the layout conformance sweep non-deterministic. Its state
// is the ordinary one — a measured site with a scheduled publish — because
// that is the state every other screen is built against; the four
// no-publish arms and the never-measured arm are exercised by
// `tests/app/shell/`, which drives `assembleShell` directly.
