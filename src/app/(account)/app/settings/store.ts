// BUILD §4.7 — every settings fact, read for the account that owns it.
//
// Until #228 `readSettings` spread `FIXTURE_SETTINGS_FACTS` and overrode
// four groups, so ten facts reached a real signed-in customer from the
// fixture: the mode their pages publish under, the veto window, the publish
// time, the zone, whether publishing is on at all, their voice, their
// do-not-claim list, their notification switches, their page count and
// REQ-071's pending market change. Every one is now read.
//
// **The fixture is behind `isReservedFixtureAccount` and nowhere else**
// (DECISIONS 2026-09-06, and #192's rule): `example.com` is IANA-reserved,
// so no customer can hold the name that reaches it.
//
// **Two facts degrade; the other eight do not, and that asymmetry is the
// point.** A fixture value is a *claim* — a mode the customer never chose,
// a date nobody measured — and a customer acting on one is worse off than a
// customer told the product could not read it. Billing and destinations
// have a stated degraded arm because REQ-097 c5 and c6 design one for them.
// The rest have none: there is no honest way to draw a veto window or a
// do-not-claim list that was not read, and a default in its place is the
// same defect as the fixture with a different provenance. Those reads
// propagate, and the route's own error boundary is what the customer meets
// — a screen that failed, rather than a screen quietly stating settings
// they never chose.
//
// **Every read is bounded and made concurrently** (DECISIONS 2026-09-07,
// #186): this screen is dynamic, so an unsettled read would hang it, and
// ten sequential reads would be ten round trips deep on a database that is
// slow.
