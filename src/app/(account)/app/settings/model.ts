// BUILD §4.7 — the whole of what Settings states, in one shape.
//
// WO-179 `## Goal`: "Assemble `SettingsModel` from one read of `sites`,
// `destinations` and `users`, with notification toggles projected from the
// stoppable subset of `MAIL_KINDS` rather than hand-written."
//
// `assembleSettings` is pure: facts in, model out. The reading of those facts
// is `provider.ts`'s, and today it reads a fixture — issue #18 builds this
// screen on fixture data behind the typed provider, exactly as issue #9 built
// the shell. Keeping the assembly pure is what lets every criterion be
// decided by a test with no database at all.
//
// The model carries a value for each `SETTABLE` key and
// nothing a control could bind to besides. It carries no measurement, no
// derived number and no billing figure at all: REQ-097 keeps the next
// invoice, the card and the invoice history off every ReachKit surface
// (`billing.ts` records the owner's ruling on which of §4.7's four things
// survive it), and `content.pages` is a count of the customer's own
// published pages, which is not a billing value and not a measurement.
//
// **`vetoHours` is read, never corrected.** WO-179 step 5: the rule — a whole
// multiple of 24 in [0, 168] — belongs to the publishing settings writer
// (issue #46) and to nothing else. "A read that 'corrects' a stored value
// would hide the very state [the] validator exists to prevent from ever being
// stored", so this module validates nothing and the screen renders what is
// there.
import type { CopyKey } from "@/lib/presentation/copy";
// Imported by file and not through `@/lib/market/changes`'s barrel: the

// — "keeping the assembly pure is what lets every criterion be decided by a
// test with no database at all" — and `pending.ts` imports only the week
// clock. ADR-092's idiom, applied to keep a leaf a leaf.
