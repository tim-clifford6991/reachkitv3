// BUILD §4.7 — the closed offer: what Settings may change, and what it may do.
//
// "Settings holds the three product answers plus account admin, and
// **nothing that tunes the engine** — caps, cadences, question counts, model
// choices are code constants." WO-178 `## Goal`: "Make `SETTABLE` the closed
// list of what may be written … and prove by test that no pinned engine
// parameter is settable."
//
// Two tuples, and both are load-bearing rather than documentation. The
// screen renders one control per `SETTABLE` key and one per `ACTIONS` entry
// and nothing else, `tests/app/settings/screen.test.tsx` asserts the rendered
// sets against these two, and `tests/app/settings/settable.test.ts` asserts
// `SETTABLE` disjoint from the exported names of
// `src/lib/config/constants.ts`. A pinned engine parameter that ever became
// settable would fail that last test, which is REQ-070 criterion 3 made
// mechanical: there is no list of forbidden knobs to maintain, only the two
// sets and the requirement that they never meet.
//
// The write path — `applySettings`, `POST /api/settings`, whole-request
// rejection — is not this issue's (WO-178's other half, and the change rules
// in issue #42). What lives here is the vocabulary both halves share, so the
// screen and the writer cannot disagree about what the offer is.
