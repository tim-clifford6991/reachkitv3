// BUILD §4.7, REQ-055, REQ-053 — "How your pages sound".
//
// The approved screen set gives these two answers a card of their own
// (UI-SPEC S18, issue #374). They were rows inside "Your content" before,
// which put the two constraints on what a page may say inside the card about
// pages the customer already owns — and squeezed the voice, which REQ-055
// calls "a description", into a one-line value beside an Edit button.
//
// Two settings and no third:
//
//  · **the voice** (REQ-055) — ONE field, and the whole of what ReachKit
//    knows about how a customer's pages should sound. Nothing is learned
//    about them and no second field infers a tone: the customer writes it or
//    it is empty. It is `Input`'s multi-line arm, because a description is a
//    paragraph and a box that cannot hold its content is the defect ADR-093
//    decision 2 names.
//  · **the never-claim list** (REQ-053) — entries the customer adds and
//    removes, each a claim their pages must never make, with the one written
//    line saying what the list *does*: it is a hard filter, and a draft that
//    matches an entry is held and returned to them naming the entry. That
//    line is the difference between a preference and a guarantee, which is
//    why the card states it rather than leaving the list to speak for itself.
//
// **Neither is an engine parameter** and that is why they may be here at all
// (REQ-070 criterion 3). They are constraints on content published under the
// customer's own name — §14.6 makes the customer the publisher of record —
// not a cap, a cadence, a model choice or a weight. Both keys are in
// `SETTABLE`, and `tests/app/settings/screen.test.tsx` reads every rendered
// `setting-<key>` off the document and asserts the set against it, so moving
// them between cards cannot lose one.
