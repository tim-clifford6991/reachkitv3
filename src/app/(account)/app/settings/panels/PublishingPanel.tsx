// BUILD §4.7 — "**Publishing** (mode toggle, veto window stepper 0–7d default
// 24h, publish time, destinations list with health + Reconnect; footnote:
// *'Fix-type tasks are never automated, whatever the mode.'*)".
//
// Six of the fourteen settable keys: `mode`, `veto_hours`, `publish_time`,
// `time_zone`, `publishing_enabled` and `destinations`. §4.7 draws four of
// them; the other two are REQ-070 criterion 1's — "the time zone those times
// are stated in" and "whether pages publish at all" — and they belong on this
// card because every time on it is expressed in the first and nothing on it
// happens without the second.
//
// **The footnote is not decoration.** §9's autopilot limits are stated as
// holding "regardless of settings: ≤1 publish/day, ≤8/week; **Fix never
// automates**", and §7 marks the `unblock` type "instruction only, never
// generated, never automated". A customer who reads a mode toggle as "the
// product now does everything" has been misled by the control, so the
// sentence sits under the control that would mislead them.
//
// **Health is a state, not an error** (ADR-086, WO-179 step 4). `expired`
// carries Reconnect and the queue holds; `error` is a third state, not a
// failure this card apologises for. All three read as words rather than as
// colour alone — `Badge` requires a text child for exactly that reason.
//
// **The state is the band; the reason is the line and the action** (#48,
// ADR-086). Three states the customer reads, and under one of them the
// written line that says what is true of their pages — which differs
// between a record that was never pointed, a credential that has run out
// and a credential that is valid and cannot publish. This card renders the
// registry's `DestinationView` entire and maps nothing of its own: the
// action comes from the view, so the control offered here is the one the
// engine decided on.
//
// **`reconnect_other_account` is its own control.** A destination whose
// credential is valid and simply cannot publish must not be offered
// ordinary Reconnect — re-entering the same credential is the one action
// guaranteed to change nothing. It is a union member rather than a
// relabelled button, so a card that offered the wrong one here would fail
// to compile.
//
// The mode toggle is labelled with the mode word, the same choice the shell's
// own publishing card makes and for the same reason: naming a control by what
// it controls, rather than minting a second sentence to sit beside it. Both
// read from the one pair of keys in `laws.ts`, so the sidebar and this card
// cannot end up calling the same mode two different things.
