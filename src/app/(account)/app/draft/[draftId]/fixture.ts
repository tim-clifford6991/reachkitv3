// BUILD §4.6 — the draft view's facts, as a fixture.
//
// **This is the reserved fixture account's draft, and nobody else's.**
// `provider.ts` answers `isReservedFixtureAccount` from here and reads every
// other account's draft from `store.ts`, so what this file holds is one
// account's data rather than a placeholder for a missing read. It is what
// keeps the layout and visual sweeps deterministic.
//
// Where each field comes from for a live account:
//
//   bodyMd / bodyMdGenerated / groundedFact → §8 generation
//   claim                                   → §8's claim check
//   state / autoApprovesAt                  → §9 publishing
//   firstEditedAt / lastSavedAt             → the `drafts` row (§10)
//   mode / timeZone                         → the `sites` row
//
// The ids are the calendar's own (`../../calendar/fixture.ts` keys every
// draft `draft-{date}`), so "Read the full page" on the day panel lands on
// a draft this file holds rather than on a not-found line. `draft-2026-09-15`
// is the calendar fixture's `in_review` page — the one stage §4.6 gives this
// view a way in from — and it is the id the layout conformance sweep renders.
//
// Nothing here moves with the clock: a fixture whose dates drifted would
// make the layout sweep non-deterministic, and the veto deadline is a
// number this screen states.
