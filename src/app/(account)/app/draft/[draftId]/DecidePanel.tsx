// UI-SPEC S16 — the draft's right-hand rail: "Decide · solid Approve · Edit
// · Veto (warn) · 'If you do nothing' info · Checks list".
//
// It is `Panel` — §2.2's one registered panel, the same box S15 stands the
// calendar's day detail in (`src/ui/components/custom/DayPanel.tsx` says
// why there is one box and not two). At and above the wide band it sits
// beside the page, 290px and sticky; below it, in flow under the page. Not
// a drawer, at any width.
//
// **Nothing here decides which controls exist.** `draftActionsFor` projects
// them from §9's transition table, so this rail and the calendar's day
// panel cannot offer different actions for one state (REQ-044 c3). What
// this file decides is the *rank* each takes in the rail, which is the
// idiom's and is read off the action itself rather than off its position:
// Approve is the screen's one solid primary and takes the full column;
// Edit is the quiet tertiary and Veto the warn outline, sharing the row
// under it. A state that offers none of them — a page past review — draws
// no control block at all rather than an empty row.
