// BUILD §4.5 · UI-SPEC S12 — this week: the seven-day strip, and the one
// supply statement.
//
// §4.5 item 5, verbatim: "**This week**: 7-day strip (done/today/next) +
// 'Open calendar →' + up to two alerts (today's page pending veto → 'Read
// it'; a needs-you item → action button)."
//
// **The alerts are their own card since #353.** The approved set draws two
// cards where §4.5 wrote one region: "This week" (the strip, with the
// calendar control in its head) and "Needs you" (the tinted panels). The
// set is the newer owner artifact and this file follows it — see
// `NeedsYouModule.tsx`, which is where the alerts, the overflow count and
// the empty state moved. What stays here is the week itself and the supply
// statement, which is a fact about this week's pages rather than something
// waiting on the customer.
//
// **Identity is never colour alone.** Every day carries its own date and the
// written word for its state — the set draws no word in the cell, so the
// word is the cell's accessible text (`WeekStrip`, issue #521) and the strip
// still says what it means with the colours removed (§2.4). The three words
// are §4.5's own; the model picks which, and this file only reads them.
//
// **One supply statement, never two.** `readSupplyStatement` returns at most
// one key even where all three conditions hold; this file renders the one it
// gets and has no branch that could add a second.
