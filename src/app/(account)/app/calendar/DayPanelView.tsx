// BUILD §4.6 — the day panel's contents.
//
// "**Day panel** (290px, sticky, beside the grid — not a drawer): **today
// selected on open**. Contents: stage badge + date · title · status rows ·
// 'Why this page' … · stage-appropriate actions … · one dim provenance
// line."
//
// Two arms, and the union `DayCell` gives them is what keeps them apart:
//
//  - **A page.** Stage badge and date, the title, the status row its stage
//    earns, the five "Why this page" rows, and the one provenance line
//    (REQ-043 c10).
//  - **No page.** The date's **one** account and nothing else (c11: "it
//    states which kind of empty day it is, carrying the one account
//    criterion 5 gives that date and no other … and it offers no action
//    that would publish or approve a page"). No action is filtered out
//    here: `actionsFor` returns nothing for a cell with no page, so there
//    is no filter to forget.
//
// Every sentence is read through `writtenLine`, not `copy`: this panel
// renders on a route the customer reaches, in states whose lines the owner
// has not written yet, and a screen that throws is worse in every way than
// a screen that omits a line nobody has written (the shell's own
// `written.ts`, issue #9, states the argument in full).
//
// The action controls are `Btn` — the registered component — and the three
// commands call the declared publishing seam (`publishing.ts`), which is
// stubbed honestly until §9 lands. Nothing here tells the customer a
// command succeeded.

 *    earns. `actionsFor` offers at most one, so the block control cannot
 *    become two. It is the SOLID rank where it leads further into the
 *    customer's own work (read the page; reconnect the destination), and
 *    the OUTLINE rank where it leaves the product for the live page: §9.1
 *    gives a screen one filled button, and a control that navigates away
 *    is not the thing the panel is asking for.
 *  - **A stop is the outline rank on `warn`** — the arm issue #271 spent
 *    that tone on, for exactly this pairing: a veto stands beside an
 *    approve, the two are opposite consequences and one destroys the
 *    draft. `skip` is the same §9 edge under §4.6's other word, so it
 *    takes the same rank.
 *  - **Move and a restart are quiet.** Move re-deadlines a page and asks
 *    nothing of anyone; a restart stands beside a reconnect that already
 *    holds the fill.
 *
 * The two half-width controls share one row under the block one, each
 * taking half of it however long its word is (`day-panel.css`).
 *
 * The link is an anchor carrying the registered `btn` classes rather than
 * a `Btn`, the way the month switcher's neighbours and the Overview's two
 * links already are: it navigates, so it is an `<a>` with no client
 * runtime, and `Btn` renders a `<button>` with an `onClick`. Declared in
 * `tests/ui/design/component-registry.test.ts`'s exception list with that
 * reason.
