// BUILD §4.3 — the closed shape of the one submit, and the one write path
// into setup completion.
//
// The archived plan is WO-146. "Three cards, one submit" (§4.3): a field
// absent from `SetupSubmission` cannot be sent, which is how REQ-025
// criterion 1's "and for nothing else" is enforced rather than reviewed.
// **No field here can carry a duration, an estimate or an engine
// parameter** — no cadence, no cap, no question count, no model choice —
// and `tests/app/setup/submit.test.ts` pins the member list so a fourth
// decision cannot be added by adding a field.
//
// **The writes are a declared interface, and that is why this file never
// changed when they became real.** `SetupStore` is the seam: the account,
// the site row and the deep-pass queue are all written behind it.
// `liveSetupStore` in `_setup/store.ts` is the implementation
// `_setup/provider.ts` returns for every founder; the fixture in
// `_setup/fixture.ts` remains, recording what it was asked to do, for the
// suites that drive `completeSetup` without a database. This file holds
// neither, and nothing here pretends a row was written.
