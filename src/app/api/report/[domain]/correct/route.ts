// src/app/api/report/[domain]/correct/route.ts — BUILD §6.7 — the transport adapter over
// the one market correction (§6.7 step 5).
//
// A thin adapter and nothing more: it parses the address segment and one
// body field, asks the market module whether a correction is on offer,
// asks the state machine what a submission does to the stored state, and —
// only where that advances — starts one re-measurement inside the scan it
// corrects. It holds no state table, no threshold, no allowance arithmetic
// and no SQL of its own, and it decides nothing about availability.
//
// **Nothing is spent by a refusal this route makes.** Where the offer is
// closed, the state machine is never asked to advance anything; where the
// run cannot start at all — the kill switch, or no pipeline registered —
// the machine is asked with `refused_before_run`, which returns the
// current state unchanged, and neither of the reader's two attempts is
// used. The two refusal vocabularies are kept apart on the wire as they
// are in the machine: a correction already under way answers
// `already_running`, one already spent answers `already_used`, and the two
// are never collapsed into one key.
//
// **The re-measurement is issue #25's `runScan`**, reached through the seam
// `@/lib/scan/correction` declares. This route never calls
// `admitFreeScan` or `claimFreeScanSlot`: a correction re-measures inside
// the scan it corrects, spends no further scan allowance and opens no
// second spend ceiling, and there is no call here through which it could.
//
// This route returns handles, never sentences: every key below is turned
// into a written line by the copy registry, on the surface that renders it.
