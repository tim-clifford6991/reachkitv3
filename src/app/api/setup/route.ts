// src/app/api/setup/route.ts — BUILD §4.3
//
// The one write path into setup completion (REQ-025 c2: "one action starts
// the product"). A transport adapter and nothing else (`ARCHITECTURE.md`
// rule 1): it parses the body to the closed `SetupSubmission` shape, calls
// `completeSetup()`, and maps `SetupResult` to a response. It holds no
// engine logic, no SQL and no sentence.
//
// **`siteId` is never read from the request body.** It comes from the
// account behind the session, through the store — a founder cannot name
// another founder's site by editing a payload.
//
// **The account is the session's, since #133.** `currentSession()`
// (BP-061, #35, on Supabase Auth since #468) is the whole of it: Supabase
// verifies the session and the account's tombstone is checked there, and
// this file adds no claim of its own. `src/middleware.ts` has already
// refused a request that carries no cookie at all, so the `null` arm below
// is the forged, expired or ended one — answered the way every other
// account endpoint answers it, with a status and no sentence.
