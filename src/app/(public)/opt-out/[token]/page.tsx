// src/app/(public)/opt-out/[token]/page.tsx — BUILD §4.2
//
// The page behind the link every lead-directed mail carries. It applies the
// token on arrival and renders a total switch over the three things that
// can have happened — nothing else is on it: no control, no form, no field,
// no re-subscribe control, no navigation into the product, and the address
// is never echoed back, because an opt-out link forwarded to someone else
// must not disclose whose it was.
//
// Renders without a session, a cookie or a payment: `/opt-out/{token}` is
// on `PUBLIC_PATHS` and this file sits under `(public)`, whose layout
// declares nothing about sessions.
//
// Every sentence is a registry key. `optout.unavailable` is owner-owed, so
// `copy()` throws on it rather than rendering a blank line — the intended
// blocking point, and it blocks copy, not structure.
