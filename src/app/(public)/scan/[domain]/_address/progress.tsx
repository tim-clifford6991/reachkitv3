// BUILD §4.1 — the scanning arm's named stages
//
// REQ-003 c1: named stages that advance as work completes — never an
// unlabelled spinner, never an indeterminate bar alone, and no elapsed
// time, percentage or countdown, because `Steps` carries none.
//
// REQ-001 c9: arriving on a shared link starts a scan with no further
// action from the visitor. The post happens **on first frame, in the
// browser** and never during server render — a server render that started
// a scan would start one for every crawler, prefetch and refresh.
//
// REQ-003 c3: the ending event swaps the report in without a reload. This
// component asks the router to re-render the route rather than reloading
// the document: the server resolves the address again, now finds a stored
// report, and the `report` arm replaces this one in place.
//
// The stream is `GET /api/scan/{scanId}/progress` (server-sent events),
// which serialises `@/lib/scan/stages`' own `StageEvent` verbatim.
//
// **`StageName` is imported as a type and never as a value.**
// `src/lib/scan/stages.ts` imports `dbAdmin`, and through it
// `src/lib/config/env.ts`, which parses the server's environment at module
// load — a value import of `STAGES` from a `"use client"` module would
// drag the admin database client and the whole server environment into the
// browser bundle. The six handles are the keys of `STAGE_KEY` below, whose
// `satisfies Record<StageName, CopyKey>` is the compile-time guarantee
// that they are exactly the six the engine declares: a seventh stage
// added there fails this file's build until it has a word here.
