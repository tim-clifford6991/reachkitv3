// BUILD §4.1 — what one visit to /scan/{domain} resolves to
//
// The closed union the address renders exactly one arm of, plus the two
// smaller unions a `report` arm carries. Types only: this file decides
// nothing and reads nothing. Who *resolves* a visit to an arm is issue
// #25's (`readCurrentReport`, the pipeline) and #28's (removal); what a
// resolved arm looks like on screen is `view.tsx`'s.
//
// Totality is the whole point. `view.tsx` switches over `kind` with a
// `never` default, so a seventh arm added here fails the build until it
// has a rendering — which is what makes "never a blank page, a 404 or an
// unhandled error" a property rather than a review note.
