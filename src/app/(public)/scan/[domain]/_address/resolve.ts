// BUILD §4.1 — what one visit to /scan/{domain} resolves to, from the store
//
// The eight-row first-match order that turns a written domain into exactly
// one arm of `AddressState`. #13 declared the union and rendered it from
// fixtures; #100 landed the pipeline and `readCurrentReport`. This is the
// join: it composes `parseDomain`, `admitFreeScan` and `readCurrentReport`
// and holds no SQL, no vendor call and no measurement of its own
// (`ARCHITECTURE.md` rule 1 — an adapter over the engine's own interfaces,
// which is what DECISIONS 2026-09-05/#83 permits under `src/app/`).
//
// **The order is the promise, and reordering it changes what a visitor is
// shown.** First match wins:
//
//   1. the segment does not parse            → `malformed`
//   2. the domain's report was removed        → `removed`
//   3. a current report exists                → `report` (+ one notice, one control)
//   4. a scan for *this* domain is running    → `scanning`
//   5. a scan here failed inside the cooldown → `cooldown`
//   6. admission refuses for any other reason → `refused`
//   7. otherwise                              → `starting`
//
// Row 2 outranks every row below it and that is the whole of REQ-002 c3: a
// report withdrawn on the site owner's written request is shown to nobody,
// including the visitor whose scan would otherwise have started one. Row 3
// outranks rows 4–6 because a stored report is a thing to read: a refusal
// or a cooldown then travels as a *notice beside the report* (the arms
// `AddressNotice` carries), never as a screen that hides what was already
// measured.
//
// **Nothing here starts a scan.** Row 7 hands the visitor the `starting`
// arm and `ScanProgress` posts `/api/scan` from the browser on first
// frame — REQ-001 c9's "never during server render", which is what keeps
// a crawler, a prefetch or a refresh from spending money.
