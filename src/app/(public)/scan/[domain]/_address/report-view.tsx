// BUILD §4.1 — the report, whole
//
// The six modules in §4.1's order, at most one notice, exactly one control
// (or none), and the removal address at the foot. A screen composition,
// not a registry row: every visible element is one of `src/ui/components`'
// registered rows or a layout element around them.
//
// §4.1's own order, with the two 2026-09-03 amendments folded in:
//   1. verdict strip — score, band, one written line. No driver bars.
//   2. two equal cards, side by side — AI answers · Google search. Each
//      one leads with its verdict and draws its own figure: §2.4's AI
//      dot matrix on the left, its presence bars on the right (issue
//      #352). No per-question volume, no market-total footnote.
//   3. three problem cards.
//   4. three DIY collapses.
//   5. free page card.
//   6. pricing card.
//
// **Nothing on this screen branches on payment, session or tier.** There
// is no parameter here that could carry one, which is how REQ-004 c5's "no
// part hidden, blurred, rounded down, locked, or marked as available on
// payment" is discharged — by there being nothing to pass.
//
// A section the scan could not produce renders as a named absent section
// with one written line (REQ-004 c10/c11) — never an empty card, never a
// spinner — and the rest of the report stays usable.

          declares `medium: columns:2`, and until `surface.css` existed that
          declaration rendered nothing — so the two-up rows carried their own
          `lg:grid-cols-2`, the same 1024px boundary written a second time,
          and the column's own width and air were three raw values
          (`max-w-[1060px]`, `mx-auto`, `p-6`) beside the two ruled measures.
          All of it is the container's now: `--w-wide` 1216px is
          `design/tokens.md` §2b's "multi-column content column — the public
          report's six modules", which is this screen by name.

          `<main>` stays the landmark and spans the arm's tracks, and
          `grid-cols-subgrid` puts the rows below on *those* tracks rather
          than on a second set of its own: the two-up cards take one track
          each, and a row that spans the screen says so once, in
          `col-span-full`. At compact the grid is one column and every span
          is a no-op. `display: contents` would read the same and is wrong

          check 2 to contain its children in, so every row reported as
