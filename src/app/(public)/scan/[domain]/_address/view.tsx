// BUILD §4.1 — the total switch over what a visit resolved to
//
// Exactly one arm renders. The `switch` is total over `AddressState.kind`
// with a `never` default, so an eighth arm added to `state.ts` fails the
// build until it has a rendering here — which is what makes "never a blank
// page, a 404 or an unhandled error" a property of the type rather than a
// promise in prose.
//
// Every line on every arm is a `CopyKey`. The `malformed` arm reuses the
// landing page's own five `landing.problem.*` lines rather than minting
// five more: same union, same wording obligation, one home per claim.
