// BUILD §4.1 module 1 — the verdict strip
//
// The score, its band word, the domain and the date it was measured, and
// one written line naming the factor holding the score down.
//
// **No driver mini-bars and no factor value, anywhere** (DECISIONS
// 2026-09-03, superseding §4.1's own header-strip wording). The line names
// the limiting factor without stating that factor's value, its weight, or
// how the score is put together — and `Verdict` carries no `factors`
// member, so there is no value here to render by mistake.
//
// The unmeasured arm renders the dash, **no band element at all**, still
// names the domain and the date, and carries one line per factor with no
// value, saying which of the two reasons applies to each. A measured zero
// is a zero: `renderMeasured`'s own trichotomy decides which, and it is
// not re-implemented here.
