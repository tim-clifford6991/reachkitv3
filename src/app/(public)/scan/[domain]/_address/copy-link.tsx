// BUILD §4.1 — the copy-link control
//
// REQ-001 c7: the value it copies is the canonical address, with no token
// and no expiry — the same address any other visitor would reach. The URL
// is handed in, never composed here, so there is one place a report
// address is built.
//
// It is not a member of the `AddressControl` union: that union governs
// controls that *start a measurement* ("exactly one, or none"), and this
// starts none. It coexists with any arm of it.
//
// A Client Component only because the clipboard is a browser API. With no
// client runtime the control renders and does nothing — the address is
// still in the browser's own address bar, which is why this needs no
// no-JavaScript fallback of its own.
