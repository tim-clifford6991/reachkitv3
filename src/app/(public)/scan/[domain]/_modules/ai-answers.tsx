// BUILD §4.1 module 2, left card — AI answers
//
// "AI answers appear on {m} of your 12 biggest searches", the per-rival
// rows over those m, and "The 12 questions" beneath a divider. Leads with
// the answer, not the metric; carries its source as one quiet chip; states
// its method in one line.
//
// **Two things this card deliberately does not hold.** No per-question
// `{vol}/mo` — the owner removed it on 2026-09-03 and `StoredQuestion` has
// no volume member to render. And no dot matrix of its own: the AI
// dot-matrix is `BUILD.md` §2.4's closed chart inventory, owned by issue
// #11, so it arrives here as a named, absent-safe `matrix` slot. The rows
// are direct-labelled either way — name and value in writing — so the card
// says everything it claims with the slot empty (§2.4: "identity is never
// colour-alone").
//
// Question wording is model text and reaches this file only through
// `renderQuestion`, which will not yield the wording without the search it
// came from (REQ-093 c3).
