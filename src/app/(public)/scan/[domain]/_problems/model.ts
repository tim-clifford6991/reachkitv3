// BUILD §4.1 module 3 — three counts become three problem cards
//
// One severity that follows its own count and nothing else, and one `Fix`
// arm that cannot hold lines a founder should not paste. No JSX, no string
// a person reads, no React import: the rendering is `cards.tsx`'s and this
// file is what it renders.
//
// The severity boundaries are `SEVERITY_THRESHOLDS`
// (`src/lib/config/constants.ts`) — never restated here — so severity is a
// step function of exactly one number, reading no denominator, tier,
// market or date. That is what makes "the larger count never carries the
// lower severity" a property of the code rather than a convention.
