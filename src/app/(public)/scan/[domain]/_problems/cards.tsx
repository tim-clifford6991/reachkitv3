// BUILD §4.1 module 3 — the three problem cards
//
// Count, severity in words, who does the work, and the paste block on the
// one arm that carries lines. Rendered from `model.ts`'s three-tuple and
// from nothing else, so this file cannot reach a report field the model
// did not hand it.
//
// The severity word is `SEVERITY[SEVERITY_INDEX[level]]` —
// `src/lib/presentation/bands.ts` declares `SEVERITY` as an ordered triple
// ascending in the count, not a record keyed by the handle, so
// `SEVERITY[level]` does not type-check and the ordering has exactly one
// home. The tone rides beside the word and never instead of it: a severity
// shown in colour alone would be unreadable to a reader who cannot see the
// colour, and REQ-004 c4's rule against that is general.
//
// A count that could not be measured shows the dash for the count *and*
// for the severity, carries the reason-specific written line, and holds no
// lines to paste — a founder is never shown a robots directive derived
// from a measurement that did not happen.
