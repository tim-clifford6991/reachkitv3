# Capability Index — what already exists

> Rule 7.2: before any file plan is written, the planner searches this index
> AND the codebase for an existing implementation. Duplicating an indexed
> capability requires an ADR explaining why reuse was rejected.
>
> Rule 7.1: every capability is owned by exactly one BP node.
>
> Seeded 2026-08-31 from the container/component skeleton (BP-001..BP-019) and
> extended the same day with the forty-four feature nodes (BP-020..BP-063).
> Re-swept 2026-09-01 against ADR-084 (published live at every destination),
> ADR-072, ADR-085 and ADR-086: one capability added (`src/lib/publish/record/`,
> BP-045), three entry points added to existing capabilities (`canPublish()`,
> `publishCapability()`, `siteConditionFor()`), and no capability split, merged
> or re-owned. Every row still names exactly one owner.
> Every row below is **specified, not yet built** — this repo carries no `src/`.
> A row exists so that the next planner reuses the seam instead of minting a
> second one; the "Public entry point" column is the contract to call, and it is
> the blueprint's `## Public interface` verbatim.
>
> **What "one owning BP" means here, and why a component and a leaf both appear.**
> Rule 7.1 gives one capability one owning node. In this corpus a component often
> *declares* a seam that a leaf beneath it *ships*: BP-016 declares
> `scheduleSequence()` and BP-029 realises it; BP-015 declares
> `becomesPublishable()` and BP-046 ships it. That is one capability with one
> owner, not two implementations — the component's declaration is the contract
> and the leaf is the implementation, and the two are the same signature by
> construction (a divergence is drift the librarian logs, and one such divergence
> is exactly what BP-054 refused to ship silently). **This index names the leaf**
> wherever a leaf exists, because the leaf is what a planner must open to write a
> file plan and is what `code:` binds; the component is named in parentheses
> where the seam is declared elsewhere. Where no leaf exists, the component owns
> both and appears alone. A capability with two nodes and no
> declaring/implementing relation between them is a rule 7.1 conflict and would
> be logged in `structure.md`'s `## Scope conflicts`. Two are open as of
> 2026-09-01 and are **not** in that table — see `## Coverage` below.

## Coverage (rule 5.5)

A hand-authored index is silent in exactly the way a generated one is: an
absent row reads as nothing-to-report. The denominators, as of 2026-09-01:

- **97 capability rows** naming **63 of 63 blueprints** as an owner. No
  blueprint is unrepresented.
- **Leaf naming.** This file's own convention — name the leaf, put the
  declaring component in parentheses — was applied to 10 of the 32 component
  rows that have a shipping leaf when the file was seeded. The other 22 were
  corrected on 2026-09-01 (librarian): `checkCoherence` · `deriveRivals` ·
  `sizeRivals` · `phraseQuestions` · `admitFreeScan` · `progress` ·
  `deriveOpportunities` · `qualifies`/`bandWinnability` · `generateDraft` ·
  `runHardRules` · `claimCheck` · `similarity` · `TRANSITIONS`/`transition` ·
  `publish` · `verifyLive` · `DestinationAdapter` · `sendEmail` ·
  `createCheckoutSession`/`handleStripeWebhook`/`provisionFromPayment` ·
  `hasActiveAccess` · `beginEmailChange` · `exportEverything` ·
  `unpublishEverything`/`deleteAccount`. Each of those seams appeared twice in
  this file with two owners, which is the shape rule 7.1 forbids and this file
  claims not to contain.
- **Rows added 2026-09-01** (librarian), each previously absent while a work
  order was already cut against the seam: `readMeasuredText()` (WO-253),
  `assembleReport()`/`storeCurrentReport()` — the `StoredReport` write side
  (WO-255), `nextForDay()` (WO-257).
- **Two open rule 7.1 conflicts, not in `structure.md`'s `## Scope conflicts`
  table, which reads "None open".** Two `code:` globs are declared
  **identically** by two nodes each, which structure.md's own rule 2a calls a
  conflict rather than a precedence:
  `supabase/migrations/*_publications*.sql` by BP-015 **and** BP-045;
  `supabase/migrations/*_destinations*.sql` by BP-015 **and** BP-058. Which
  node withdraws is the architect's call (rule 2a: "the node that specifies the
  thing keeps the glob and the node that merely reads it withdraws"), so no
  edge is written here. This is the same shape as the `*_leads*.sql` /
  `*_suppressions*.sql` row that table already records as resolved; the fix was
  not carried across to `src/lib/publish/`.
- **Not indexed here, by design:** anything under `src/` — there is no `src/`.
  Every row is specified, none is built, and rule 7.2's second half (search the
  codebase) has nothing to search.
