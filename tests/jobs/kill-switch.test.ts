// tests/jobs/kill-switch.test.ts — BUILD §11 bounds
//
// `BUILD.md` §11: "kill switch env var stops scan+generate+publish".
//
// The three the switch stops must stop **before any spend and before any
// write** — asserted here by giving each job an engine that would record
// both, and proving it was never reached. The four it does not stop must
// still run; widening `KILL_SWITCH_SCOPE` to any of them fails a case
// below, which is the mutation the scope set is worth testing for.
//
// A stopped invocation is not a silent skip: it returns a recorded
// `stopped` outcome naming the kill switch, so the sentence §14 makes the
// product say has a fact to read. (The sentence itself is the copy
// registry's, not this module's.)
