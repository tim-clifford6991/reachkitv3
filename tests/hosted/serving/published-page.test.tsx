//
// **What the customer's own page looks like**, which until now nothing
// asserted: the head and the schema are `tests/hosted/indexing/head.test.tsx`'s
// and are not re-tested here. This file is the set's own structure — their
// mark and name, the category they chose, the title, the byline, the body
// with §8's passage marked and its source under it, the canonical note, and
// their footer line — plus the two properties that make it *theirs*: every
// value on the surface is the customer's, and nothing on it is the
// product's colour.
//
// The page is called directly and rendered to static markup, the same
// convention `head.test.tsx` uses, so there is no browser here and no
// second renderer: what is asserted is the HTML a visitor's first byte
// carries.
