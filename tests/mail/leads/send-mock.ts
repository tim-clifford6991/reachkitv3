// tests/mail/leads/send-mock.ts — §12's seam, stood in for.
//
// The flow suites are about *when* a mail is sent and what happens to the
// lead row afterwards, not about composing one: composition, the omission
// rule and the stoppability dispatch are §12's own suites. So `sendEmail`
// is replaced here with a recorder, and the templates' block lists are
// asserted separately in `tests/mail/templates/**`.
//
// It also matters that this stand-in cannot succeed by accident today:
// every sentence these three mails speak is owner-owed, so the real seam
// would refuse to compose them (`reason: 'not-composable'`) and no test
// driving the real one could observe a delivery at all. That fact is
// asserted where it belongs — `tests/mail/templates/copy-owed.test.ts` —
// rather than silently making these suites vacuous.
