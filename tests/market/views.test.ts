// tests/market/views.test.ts — BUILD §6.6
//
// The market leaves read SERPs through narrow structural views rather than
// through the vendor client's own type, so that "this module buys nothing"
// stays provable by the absence of the import. That trick is only sound
// while the vendor's real value still satisfies the views — which is what
// this file asserts, from the test side, where importing the vendor type
// costs nothing.
