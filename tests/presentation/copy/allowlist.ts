// tests/presentation/copy/allowlist.ts — ADR-010 point 1, WO-279 (supersedes WO-044)
//
// The declared allow-list of non-voice string positions ADR-010 point 1
// names — "attribute values, aria-*, test ids, class names" — as an
// explicit, reviewable data structure: one entry, one reason. Nothing else
// is allowed. `string-literal-sweep.test.ts` treats every JSX attribute as
// presumed voice by default (fail-closed) and consults this list as the
// one, narrow exemption — a new attribute a future component introduces is
// flagged until an entry is added here by name, never swallowed by a
// wildcard. That is a deliberate trade: a real non-voice attribute this
// list has not yet named costs one line here to clear (a maintenance
// point named explicitly in WO-279's return, not hidden).
