// tests/presentation/sweeps/hosted-fixture.ts — BUILD §9, issue #49
//
// The hosted edge's row in the two conformance sweeps.
//
// **Why it is mocked at all.** Every route the App Router tree holds is in
// these sweeps' scope by construction (ADR-010), and the hosted page is a
// route. It is also the one route whose *whole* input is a Host header and
// a `publications` row — a request context these in-process sweeps do not
// have and a database they must never reach (`tests/setup.ts` refuses real
// network). So the Host and the row are supplied here, and the page's own
// render is what the sweeps then measure.
//
// **What it deliberately does not mock: the render.** The template, the
// Markdown renderer, the canonical composition and the `FAQPage` block are
// the real ones — the sweeps read a real hosted page, on a real fixture
// Host, exactly as a visitor would.
//
// The page speaks no sentence of ReachKit's (it reads no copy key at all),
// so it has nothing to say under a stop and nothing to leave blank at cold
// start. That is the answer the sweeps should get from it, and it is worth
// getting from the real file rather than from an exemption list.
