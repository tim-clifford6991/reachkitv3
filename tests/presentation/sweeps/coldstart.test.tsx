//
// The cold-start law, swept: every route the App Router tree holds, rendered
// for a domain that ranks for nothing, and asserted per rendered document.
// The scope is the file tree, not a list — so a screen added later is in
// scope the day its `page.tsx` lands (REQ-091 criterion 2's "including
// screens added later"), and a route with no harness row fails naming the
// file rather than being skipped.
//
// **Two describes throughout.** One over the synthetic tree under
// `__fixtures__/routes/`, where each rule must flag its own planted
// violation and nothing else; one over `src/app`, where every rule must flag
// nothing. Without the first, deleting a rule would leave the second
// passing.
//
// **`copy()` is real here.** The assertions are about what stands on the
// screen — a blank, a dash, another customer's rival — so the sentences have
// to be the ones a reader would read. Which *key* a line resolves from is
// `coldstart-keys.test.tsx`'s question and is asked there.
