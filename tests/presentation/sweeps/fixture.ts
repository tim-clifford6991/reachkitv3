// tests/presentation/sweeps/fixture.ts — REQ-091, BUILD §6.6
//
// The cold-start fixture: a domain that resolves, serves a readable home
// document, **ranks for nothing and is cited in no AI answer**. It is the
// customer REQ-091's user story names, and the one the product exists for.
//
// Nothing here carries an estimate, a benchmark, a cohort average, or a
// manufactured rival, target, question or opportunity. That is what makes
// criterion 3's assertion mean something: a filler value seeded here would
// make "nothing stands in the place of what the customer does not have"
// vacuous.
//
// The report half is `src/app/(public)/scan/[domain]/_fixture/states.ts`'s
// `cold-start.example.com` arm, which issue #13 already built as exactly
// this case ("the measurement happened and the answer is zero"). This file
// defines no second one (rule 7.2); it names it, and adds the app-side
// facts the shell reads, which that file does not hold.
