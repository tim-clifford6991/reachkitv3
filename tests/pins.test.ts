// tests/pins.test.ts — BUILD §1: "`src/lib/config/constants.ts` **every**
// pinned number in this document, `tests/pins.test.ts` asserting them."
//
// Issue #8. Every pin in `src/lib/config/constants.ts` asserted against the
// clause that rules it, by quotation and never by line number: the clause is
// the test's name, and a second block asserts every quoted clause is still
// the words the owner files use. A pin that drifts fails here; a clause that
// is reworded fails here too, and the pin is re-read rather than re-typed.
//
// This file runs first (`vitest.config.ts`'s `PinsFirstSequencer`) and under
// a second, so a drifted constant fails before anything expensive runs.
//
// Where the ruling clause lives in the frozen corpus (`archive/`, frozen
// 2026-09-04 and never written to) it is quoted by id and text without a
// drift check: a frozen document cannot drift. Where it lives in `BUILD.md`,
// `DECISIONS.md` or `DATA-COSTS.md` — the three that can — the quote is
// checked.
//
// Companion file: `tests/config/constants.test.ts` is structural (frozen,
// imports nothing, carries no band word). Values live here.
