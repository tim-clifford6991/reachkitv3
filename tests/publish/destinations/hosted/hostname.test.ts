// tests/publish/destinations/hosted/hostname.test.ts — SPEC §5 (2026-09-12)
//
// The host a customer's pages are served at: whether it is free, whether it
// is on the project, which of §5's two words the customer reads, and how
// often the vendor is asked. Only the domain list's own verification reads
// "live" — a record can resolve at a host Vercel was never told about.
