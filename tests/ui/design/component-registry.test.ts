// tests/ui/design/component-registry.test.ts — §2.2, ADR-010
//
// §2.2, verbatim: "daisyUI components only — no bespoke widgets" …
// "Custom CSS is allowed only for: the calendar grid, the day panel, the
// AI dot-matrix, chart SVGs, and the sidebar — nothing else."
//
// Two closed lists, and this file is what closes them:
//
//  * the component list — every daisyUI class the product writes has to
//    belong to one of the fourteen registered components, and the fourteen
//    are the barrel `src/ui/components/index.ts` exports. No fifteenth
//    daisyUI component is reached by writing its class by hand — which is
//    the only way left, since an unregistered widget has nowhere to be
//    exported from.
//  * the custom-CSS list — five surfaces, asserted by path glob over the
//    tree rather than against a list of known files (ADR-010), so a
//    stylesheet nobody told this test about still fails it.
//
// Both rules are decided from the installed daisyUI's own stylesheets; see
// `vocabulary.ts` for why that source and not a hand-copied list.
