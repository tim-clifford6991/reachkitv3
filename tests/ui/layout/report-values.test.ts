// tests/ui/layout/report-values.test.ts — BUILD §2.3, §4.1, issue #244
//
// The defect the five-width sweep cannot see.
//
// `rival-three.example.org` drew as `…example.o` / `rg` on the report's
// presence card at 1024 and 1280: the label column was capped at
// `minmax(3rem, 8rem)` and the domain wrapped **mid-word** inside it.
// Checks 1 to 4 are all geometric — no horizontal document scroll, every
// border box contained, `scrollWidth <= clientWidth`, and the type floor —
// and a value that wraps mid-word violates none of them. It is contained,
// it is not clipped, it is not scrolled and it is not shrunk. It is simply
// a different string on the screen from the one in the database, which is
// what §2.3 sets a domain in the mono face to prevent.
//
// So this file asks the question the geometry cannot: **is any value
// broken across lines?** For every mono-faced, text-bearing element on the
// report, it measures the text's own unwrapped width with a `Range` and
// compares it against the box it was given. A value wider than its box has
// been wrapped, and a wrapped value is an offender — whatever its
// geometry says.
//
// **A single token, never a phrase.** The rule is exact: a run of mono
// text with no whitespace in it — a domain, a ratio, a count — is one
// value, and a line break inside it is always wrong. A mono *line* that
// happens to hold spaces (the free page card's target line, say) may wrap
// at them like any other text, and does not offend.
//
// It is scoped to the occupancy rows of the presence card, and to this
// route, for two reasons.
// The sweep's fifth check belongs to #241, which is rewriting `checks.ts`'s
// container rules, and one card's regression should not wait for it. And
// the same break exists one card down — `free-page.tsx` renders the rival
// it beats through `Num`, whose own `break-words` breaks a 23-character
// domain in a `minmax(0, 1fr)` track at the compact band. That is the same
// defect in a card this issue does not cover and whose two rows hold
// different kinds of content (a value and a sentence), so it is filed
// rather than folded in here.
