// tests/ui/layout/seed.ts — BUILD §2, §4.3 (issue #193)
//
// The layout conformance job's database: the migrations, one account, and
// a session cookie a real sign-in would have produced.
//
// **Why this file exists.** Since #192 the four `/app` screens verify the
// session against the `users` row, so a fixture cookie no longer gets the
// sweep past `requireAppAccount()` — every `(account)` address answered
// `/signin` and the sweep measured the sign-in prompt at five widths and
// called it the screen (`tests/app/session/account.test.ts` recorded the
// loss). The substrate #164 put in the repository is what closes it: the
// same `postgres:18` service and `scripts/db-substrate/up.sh` the `db`
// vitest project runs against.
//
// **The account is `RESERVED_ACCOUNT`, and that is the point.** It is the
// same account the presentation sweeps sign in as (`tests/app/accounts.ts`),
// so the two sweeps measure one door rather than two. Every `/app` surface
// asks `isReservedFixtureAccount()` and draws its fixture for it, which is
// what makes the sweep *deterministic*: the screens are the real
// components in their real layout, filled with the densest content each
// can hold, and no provider makes a live read on the render path. A
// non-reserved account would put five widths × four screens behind every
// provider's database read, and a read that hangs is indistinguishable
// from a broken screen (the reason `gate-state.ts` bounds its own).
//
// **The session is Supabase Auth's shape, served by a stub** (#468). The
// built app asks Supabase who a request belongs to (`getUser()`), and the
// substrate has no GoTrue to ask — so `./auth-stub.ts` answers that one
// endpoint in front of it and mints the session cookie here, in the exact
// form `@supabase/ssr` writes and reads. What that does **not** prove is
// that a real sign-in works: `generateLink` → `/auth/confirm` →
// `verifyOtp` has no server to run against here, and is the unit suites'
// (`tests/account/identity/**`, `tests/app/signin/**`). What it does prove
// is that a request carrying a verified session reaches every account
// screen, and that one carrying nothing Supabase recognises does not.
// **One run, one database** (#220). `applyMigrations` below drops and
// rebuilds `public`, so two runs sharing a database delete each other's rows
// mid-flight: this file's seeded account vanishes and every `/app` address
// redirects to `/signin`, which reads exactly like a broken screen rather
// than like contention. Locally, start the substrate with
// `eval "$(scripts/db-substrate/up.sh --run)"` — it gives this worktree its
// own database and its own ports, and the constants below read them out of
// the environment. No lock is needed. CI passes no `--run` and needs none:
// one job, one runner, one `postgres:18` service container.

/**
 * The third account: paid, and **still in setup** (issue #272).
 *
 * `/setup` and `/setup/waiting` were photographed signed out only, and
 * signing the sweep in as either of the two accounts above does not fix
 * that — it removes the screens altogether. Both have `setup_completed_at`
 * set, and REQ-025 c4 is emphatic about what that means: "a founder who has
 * answered them is never asked again". `setupRedirectFor` sends `/setup` to
 * `/app` for them, and `waiting/release.ts` releases them off
 * `/setup/waiting` the moment `TIMING.deepReleaseMin` has passed since the
 * stamp — so a picture taken as the reserved account would be a picture of
 * `/app` under a setup name, and a picture of the waiting screen would stop
 * being one ten minutes into any run slow enough to reach it late.
 *
 * The state those two screens exist in is a founder who has paid and has
 * not finished setup, and this is that founder. `setup_completed_at` is
 * null, which is also what makes the pair **time-independent**: `isReleased`
 * returns unreleased without latching anything when the stamp is absent, so
 * the waiting screen renders the same frame on the first second of a run and

 * scans; a live account with none draws the unmeasured arm of both
 * measurement tiles, whose `stat-desc` is a whole sentence of product copy
 * and whose box that sentence overflows (#211). This sweep is here to
 * measure the layout of the screen a customer sees, and a customer with a
 * measured week is the ordinary one — so the account carries weeks, and the
 * densest arm of each tile is what gets measured.
 *
 * **The blob is the real one.** `assembleReport` over `fullSections()`
 * rather than a hand-written object: every screen reading this row reads a
 * report of the shape the pipeline actually stores, so a reader added later
 * finds the field it expects instead of a hole this file did not know to
 * fill.
 *
 * The Mondays are the site's own (`weekStartFor`), stepping back with
 * `previousWeekStart`, so the week keys here are the same ones the screen
 * computes when it reads them back.
