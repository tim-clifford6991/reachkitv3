// ADR-093 decision 6, quoted in WO-269 `## Test plan`: "Each route is
// rendered at five widths … asserting: no horizontal document scroll; every
// border box contained in its containing block's padding box;
// `scrollWidth <= clientWidth` and `scrollHeight <= clientHeight` on every
// text-bearing element outside the declared truncation allow-list … and
// computed `font-size` at or above the floor." Plus BP-018 `## Public
// interface`: "Every screen root is a `Surface`" and `## Error & edge
// behavior`: "a token missing from `:root` fails a test."
//
// Check 5 joins them (issue #241): the screen root's own container. All
// four above are properties of content inside boxes and none of them fails
// on a page with zero padding, which is how a `Surface` that matched no
// stylesheet rule reached dev with every screen flush to the top-left.
//
// Enumerates the real `src/app` tree — never a fixture — and prints
// `n routes × n widths` unconditionally (rule 5.5): today `src/app/` holds
// no route (WO-269 rests-on row 5), so `n` is `0`, and that is stated
// explicitly rather than read off an empty, silent report.
