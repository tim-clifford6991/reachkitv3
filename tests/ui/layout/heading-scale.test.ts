// tests/ui/layout/heading-scale.test.ts — BUILD §2.3, issue #110
//
// The regression guard for the defect this file ships with the fix for:
// `src/ui/tailwind.css` brings Tailwind 4's preflight, preflight resets
// every heading to `font-size: inherit`, and `src/ui/type.css` stated no
// heading size — so every `h1` in the product rendered at the 15px body
// size, in the product and on the layout sweep alike, with nothing red.
//
// **It has to be a rendered assertion.** The size that matters is the one a
// browser computes after preflight, the theme sheet, the Tailwind layer and
// `type.css` have all been applied in the order the root layout imports
// them. A test that parsed `type.css` alone would have passed on the day
// this broke: the file was not wrong, it was outranked. `tests/ui/fonts.test.ts`
// pins the declared values; this file asserts what the browser does with
// them, over the real route tree.
//
// The enumerator is the route tree (ADR-010), so a screen added later is in
// scope by construction. A route with no heading of a level is not an
// offender — the assertion is per heading found, never per route.
