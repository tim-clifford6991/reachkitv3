// tests/costs/spend-guard.test.ts — the product-wide daily ceiling inside
// the cost seam (issue #329, BUILD §6.5).
//
// `daily.test.ts` is the arithmetic; this file is what `withCostContext`
// does with it: which calls are refused, what `capHit()` says afterwards,
// what the pass is marked as, and that a ledger nobody can read refuses
// nothing.
//
// The `node` project with `@/lib/db`, the cache and the ledger write all
// mocked, the idiom `rollup.test.ts` establishes — so what is asserted is
// which vendor call was made and which row was written, which is exactly
// what a ceiling changes.
