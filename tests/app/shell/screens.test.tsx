/** @vitest-environment jsdom */
// tests/app/shell/screens.test.tsx — BUILD §4.4, and the three screens the
// shell frames: BUILD §4.5 Overview, BUILD §4.6 Calendar, BUILD §4.7
// Settings.
//
// Issue #9 builds the frame, not the screens: Overview's chart and tiles are
// #15's, the calendar grid and day panel are #16's (and #10's), and the
// settings cards are #18's. What this file holds is the contract those three
// builds inherit and must not break —
//
//   1. each destination has a route, and it renders;
//   2. no page declares a `Surface` of its own, because the shell's layout
//      owns the route's one screen root (ADR-093 decision 6's sweep asserts
//      exactly one `[data-surface]` per document, and would catch a second
//      only in a browser run);
//   3. no page writes a sentence — every word comes from the registry, and a
//      line the owner has not written renders as nothing rather than as a
//      placeholder.
//
// `copy()` is mocked to `(key) => key` and `COPY` is left real, the same
// convention `frame.test.tsx` uses and for the same reason.
