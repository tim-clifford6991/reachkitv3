// tests/app/shell/nopublish.test.ts — BUILD §4.4, REQ-040 criterion 4
//
// WO-154 `## Test plan`, row 2. The criterion, verbatim: "Given no publish
// is scheduled — publishing is paused, nothing is approved, no page is
// planned, or ReachKit itself stopped the work — when the customer looks at
// the navigation, then in place of a time it carries one written line naming
// which of those is the case; where it was ReachKit that stopped, that line
// 'names ReachKit's stop as the reason no publish is scheduled' (REQ-092
// criterion 7) and never one of the other three."
//
// ADR-011: "ReachKit's own stop outranks every other cause that is also
// true." That is the property the pair tests below discriminate — a resolver
// that returned the first cause it happened to test would pass the
// one-cause-at-a-time tests and fail these.
