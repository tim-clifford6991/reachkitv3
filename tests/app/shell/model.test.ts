// tests/app/shell/model.test.ts — BUILD §4.4, REQ-040 criteria 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
//
// WO-154 `## Goal`: "Assemble `ShellModel` … the domain, a week count that
// counts measured weeks only, the waiting count, and either the next publish
// time or the first-match reason there is none."
//
// The assembly is pure (facts in, model out), so every arm below is decided
// with no database and no clock. The reading of those facts is `provider.ts`,
// asserted at the bottom against this issue's fixture.
