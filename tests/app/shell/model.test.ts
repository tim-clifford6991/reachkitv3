// tests/app/shell/model.test.ts — BUILD §4.4, REQ-040 criteria 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
//
// WO-154 `## Goal`: "Assemble `ShellModel` … the domain, a week count that
// counts measured weeks only, the waiting count, and either the next publish
// time or the first-match reason there is none."
//
// The assembly is pure (facts in, model out), so every arm below is decided
// with no database and no clock. The reading of those facts is `provider.ts`,
// asserted at the bottom against this issue's fixture.

// BUILD §4.4–§4.6, issue #169 — the surfaces under test now resolve who is
// asking through `_session/account.ts`, which reads a signed cookie and a
// `sites` row. This suite has neither, so it signs in as the reserved
// fixture account: the surfaces then take the same fixture branch they
// always took, and what changed is only how they learned whose it is.
