// tests/app/settings/settable.test.ts — BUILD §4.7, REQ-070 criteria 1 and 3
//
// WO-178 `## Test plan` rows 1 and 3, and its step 6: "`SETTABLE` ∩ exported
// keys of `src/lib/config/constants.ts` = ∅. A pinned engine parameter that
// ever becomes settable fails it."
//
// The disjointness test is the discriminating one. REQ-070 criterion 3 names a
// class — "the number of tracked questions and how they are selected, scored or
// phrased, the search locale and the country searches are run in, scan or
// publishing cadence, how many pages a day are written, cost caps, row limits,
// freshness windows, scoring weights, or which model writes a page" — and a
// test that listed those names would be a list someone has to keep. Instead it
// asserts that the two sets never meet, and reads the second of them off the
// constants module itself, so a knob added to `constants.ts` tomorrow is
// covered by a test written today.
