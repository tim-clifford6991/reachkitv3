// REQ-097
//
// WO-180 `## Test plan`, all three rows plus its two discriminating tests. The
// screen's promise is a *closed offer*: exactly the fourteen settings, exactly
// the seven actions, and nothing that tunes the engine — so the tests read the
// offer off the rendered document rather than off a list a developer keeps.
// Every control carries `data-testid="setting-<key>"` and every action
// `data-testid="action-<key>"`, and those two sets are compared with `SETTABLE`
// and `ACTIONS`.
//
// **Rendering convention.** `tests/app/**` runs under the "node" project, whose
// environment has no `document`; this file declares `jsdom` for itself with the
// docblock above, the same per-file choice `tests/app/shell/frame.test.tsx`
// makes. Unlike that file it mounts with `react-dom/client` rather than
// rendering to static markup, because two of REQ-079's claims are about what
// happens *between* two presses — a static string cannot be clicked. No test
// library is added for it: React 19 exports `act`, and a bubbling `MouseEvent`
// is what React's own root listener is waiting for.
//
// **`copy()` is mocked to `(key) => key`, and `COPY` is not** — the convention
// the shell's suites set, for the reason they state: the assertions are about
// which key a line resolves from, never about the owner's wording, and keeping
// `COPY` real is what lets `writtenLine`'s owner-owed branch behave here
// exactly as it does in production.
//
// **The action interfaces are wrapped, not replaced.** The module mock below
// records which key was called and then calls the real entry from
// `SETTINGS_ACTIONS` — the map the screen actually calls since issue #136
// wired the three billing controls — so "the control calls its declared
// interface" is asserted against the interface that ships rather than against
// a double that agrees with the test.
