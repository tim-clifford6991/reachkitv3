// BUILD §4.1 (issue #13), as amended by DECISIONS 2026-09-03. The report
// arm: the verdict strip in both its measured and unmeasured forms, the
// notice's total switch, the control's "exactly one, or none", the six
// modules in order, the absent-section rule, and the two things the owner
// removed on 2026-09-03.
//
// **Rendering convention**: `tests/app/**` runs under Vitest's `node`
// project, so this renders with `react-dom/server`'s
// `renderToStaticMarkup`, the same convention `landing.test.tsx` uses.
//
// **`copy()` is mocked to `(key) => key`.** These suites are about the
// rendered tree — which key a line resolves from, how many controls exist,
// which module is present — and mocking lets them see that without
// depending on the owner's wording either way. Most of this screen's keys
// are `TODO(copy)` today; asserting against the key is what stays true when
// the owner writes the sentence.
