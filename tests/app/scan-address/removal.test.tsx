//
// BUILD §4.1 · REQ-002 — the removal address on every report, the one
// written line a removed address serves, and the 410 the owner ruled on
// 2026-09-05 (#28). Criteria quoted verbatim from
// `archive/sdlc-factory-2026-09-04/corpus/docs/requirements/REQ-002.md`
// and `REQ-001.md`; carries WO-067's test plan, which WO-282 superseded.
//
// **Rendering convention**: `tests/app/**` runs under Vitest's `node`
// project, so this file renders with `react-dom/server`'s
// `renderToStaticMarkup`, the same convention
// `tests/app/scan-address/landing.test.tsx` uses.
//
// **`copy()` is NOT mocked here.** All three keys this surface reads were
// filled by the owner on 2026-09-04 and none is owner-owed, and two of the
// four criteria below are about the *sentence* reaching the screen intact
// — that the address a removed page names is the same address a live
// report names cannot be proved against a `(key) => key` stub, because a
// stub makes every key its own distinct answer. The suites therefore
// assert against the real registry and compare resolved strings to
// `COPY[...]`, never to a string spelled out here (WO-249's idiom: assert
// the key reached, never the sentence).

/** A source file's code with its comments removed, so a *reference* to a

 *
 *  Why this exists: this suite used to assert that `removal.address` was
 *  referenced in exactly one file under `src/`. That form counted files,
 *  not addresses, so it broke the moment `src/lib/presentation/copy/keys/
 *  mail.ts` (#79) cited the key in a comment — a mention that resolves
 *  nothing and cannot make the address differ. REQ-002 c3 wants one
 *  address, not one file: one value in the registry, every consumer
 *  resolving it through `copy()`/`COPY`, and the two removal views sharing
 *  one call site. The three assertions below say exactly that, and still
 *  fail on the thing the file count was reaching for — a second value, a
 *  second declaration, or a consumer that reaches the address any other
