// BUILD §3, UI-SPEC 3a — the public header's three parts (issue #351).
// tests/app/chrome/header.test.tsx
//
// The header is applied by `(public)/layout.tsx`, and the cold-start and
// stopped-state sweeps render each route's own `page.tsx` **without** its
// group layout — which is what makes their counts a screen's own. So the
// header's own shape is asserted here, where it renders.
//
// **What #351 changed, and why the old assertions are gone.** This file
// used to hold #290's reading — "the header carries no solid primary, and
// on `/` it carries no CTA at all" — which came from applying tokens.md
// §9.1's one-solid-primary rule to a control that appears on every screen.
// The owner's ruling 2b of 2026-09-08 supersedes it: "two solid primaries
// per screen are allowed where the artifact draws them (landing: header CTA
// + hero CTA)", and 3a fixes the header as "brand · Sign in (quiet) · one
// solid CTA" on every public route. Both are asserted below, along with the
// property that keeps REQ-001 c1 true on the landing: the CTA there is not
// a submit control, it is the control that focuses the one field.
//
// **The right slot is a closed union since #357.** Four arms — the pair, the
// landing's field CTA, the report address's copy control, and (since #371) a
// token page's own address — decided by the layout and passed in, so this
// file renders each one directly.
