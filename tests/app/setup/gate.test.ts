// tests/app/setup/gate.test.ts — BUILD §4.3, issues #36 and #133
//
// The incomplete-setup gate: the redirect matrix over
// complete/incomplete × allow-listed/not, the way out staying reachable
// with setup unfinished, and the same matrix again through the two files
// that enforce it — `src/app/(account)/layout.tsx`, which decides, and
// `src/middleware.ts`, which hands it the path — so the wiring is
// asserted rather than assumed.
//
// **#133 moved the decision off the Edge.** It used to be made in
// `src/middleware.ts`, which cannot name the asking account: the session
// read needs `next/headers`, a `node:crypto` HMAC and a database round
// trip, and that file is bundled for the Edge runtime. So the matrix below
// runs against the layout, and what is asserted of the middleware is that
// it forwards the path, overwrites a client's claim about it, and holds no
// setup knowledge of its own.
